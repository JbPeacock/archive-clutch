Peacock</p><p class="P3"> </p><p class="P3"> </p><p class="P181">Final Word</p><p class="P5">Murphy leaned back in his leather office chair. He stared up at the shifting colors and fractal patterns projected onto his ceiling, then let out a sigh. He rolled a finger across the little wheel switch in the arm of his chair to dim the lights. The sterile white that usually flooded the metal half-dome room turned yellow. Only then could Murphy see the recessed fixtures tucked away around the room and behind the squared lip of trim that ran around the top of the walls.</p><p class="P5">With the stress of the meeting now done and no other<span class="T84">s on his docket</span> until tomorrow, the Commander took a few minutes to do nothing. His mind began to wander away from Gaian military politics and off into his imagination. In a few minutes, it turned to sleep.</p><p class="P5">The Commander jumped at the sound of his door chirp<span class="T85">ing</span> three times sharply. A military visitor. He flicked his finger across the wheel, ramping the lights to full. At the same time, his other hand tapped the button for the fractal projection. Murphy fussed with his shirt and tie until they were acceptably neat and straightened his cap before tapping another button on the glass display inlaid in his desk.</p><p class="P5">The thin metal plate of the door slid aside without a sound. A tall woman <span class="T85">with short cropped brown hair</span> walked in, dressed in the brown and green of the Gaian expeditionary forces. She approached the desk and saluted the Commander.</p><p class="P5">"Commander Murphy", the woman said, "My name is Major Loren. Is this a good time, sir?"</p><p class="P5">"Good as any, Major", Commander Murphy said. "How may I help you?"</p><p class="P5">"Sir, We've just received a black box transmission from the Phobos outpost. The mission was a failure, sir. I watched the recording and prepared a report from everything we know..." The Major looked at the floor as she trailed off.</p><p class="P5">Murphy gave a smile, which he meant to be somewhat patronizing. "Well, Major Loren. I'm sure you've done a fine job, in accordance with standard protocol. Surely your direct superior would be a better judge of the information's merit? In the future, if you don't mind some professional advice, be sure to finish your sentences when addressing a superior officer. Good afternoon, Major."</p><p class="P5">"<span class="T1">Sir</span>," Major Loren said in a strained tone. Her expression was flat as she looked straight forward and crossed her arms behind her back. "Pardon me, Sir. I chose to bring the information straight to your attention as I believe it is of the most confidential nature, sir."</p><p class="P5">"Alright, that's better soldier. What is it you believe you saw in that transmission that n<span class="T85">obody</span> else, including your commanding officer, should know about?" Murphy, having misread the major before, was now curious about what was going on here.</p><p class="P5">"Sir, there are a lot of things I don't understand happening on that planet, but the ruins are ours. The squad we sent to Phobos to dig into the old research facility discovered a forgotten installation <span class="T86">that was much older still</span>."</p><p class="P5">"Okay. A long-forgotten military base. That's not all that surprising." Murphy looked the Major in the eye. It wasn't the base that gave her that look. He kept his eyes on hers, meaning to find out. "What did you see, Major?"</p><p class="P5">"There are monsters, sir. " Her eyes told him this was it, what she was dancing around.</p><p class="P5">"Monsters, Major?"  </p><p class="P5">"<span class="T1">Yes</span>, sir."</p><p class="P5">Murphy looked away. "At ease, Major." He gestured to one of the chairs she stood by. "Have a seat and let's have your report, please".</p><p class="P5">"Sir", Major Loren said. She <span class="T86">relaxed,</span> nodded quickly then pulled a small black dongle from the inside of her coat. Loren waved it over the panel. A screen slid up from the surface of the desk. "Thank you, sir. Permission to speak freely, sir?"</p><p class="P5">"Granted."</p><p class="P5">"Commander, I've never seen anything like this. <span class="T86">I've never even heard rumors of anything like this.</span> If I'm right about what this means, I believe <span class="T86">certain factions within</span> the Gaian military ha<span class="T86">ve</span> been hiding some very unethical research from the rest of the Commonwealth."</p><p class="P5">"<span class="T86">Save the conjecture. </span>I'll draw my own conclusions, Major. <span class="T86">P</span>roceed with <span class="T86">your</span> report."</p><p class="P5">A computer generated representation of the planet appeared on the screen. It rotated on its axis in a corner while a bullet point list of the planets statistics scrolled past. The details about the Phobos outpost caught the Commander's attention as the Major began to speak.</p><p class="P5">"Phobos is the commonwealth's only outpost in the Astra Planeta system, G.G.C. 7, <span class="T86">50,</span> -3. They are currently on priority 5, near-negligible. The administrating officer, Major Eric Hayden, kept his paperwork in order. Our records show nothing out of the ordinary until we got the distress signal six weeks ago."</p><p class="P5">Murphy folded his fingers together and settled back in his chair. "Alright. Will you pull up Major Hayden's file?"</p><p class="P5">Major Loren waved a finger over the panels, swiping the information from her tablet to the commander's terminal. Hayden's dossier appeared. He was a serious looking man, not meant for a distant outpost like Phobos, at least by Murphy's measure. Unless he <span class="T86">was</span> in some trouble. "Continue, Major Loren." He read up on Hayden while Loren talked.</p><p class="P5">"The signal we received from Phobos was coded distress. However, the Major's personal report never followed. We dispatched a Special Response ship, who reported a safe landing. I've prepared a stream of the operation from the black box of Captain Sean Graham, the Skald for that mission."</p><p class="P5">The Commander put up his finger as he finished the paragraph he was reading in Hayden's file. "Thank you, Major." He pressed a button on the panel, bringing the file down to the table. A moment later, the <span class="T86">large projected image</span> turned into a soldier's eye view of the outside of Phobos <span class="T86">station</span>. The image was still, awaiting the Major's command to begin.</p><p class="P5"><span class="T86">Murphy folded this hands in front of him. He said, </span>"Alright, Major."</p><p class="P173">Loren began the playback.</p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P4">Phobos</p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P144">The outpost was in a state of disrepair beyond Murphy's realm of conce<span class="T86">ption</span> for a <span class="T86">Gaian</span> <span class="T86">C</span>ommonwealth installation. Instinct told him that something was very wrong. He heard his thoughts echoed by Skald Captain Graham, who's black box feed was constantly recorded during the mission.</p><p class="P144">"Place's an unsettling disaster, sir," <span class="T86">Graham</span> said to the man next to him, "be careful, boyos. <span class="T86">So far I think</span> Phobos is aptly named. <span class="T86">L</span>et's hope we've seen the extent of it."</p><p class="P174">The <span class="T86">squad</span> approached the door. Captain Graham looked around, showing the alkaline white ground. Skeletal black trees towered <span class="T86">twenty meters in the distance.   They surrounded</span> the <span class="T86">i</span>nstallation, <span class="T86">suggesting that a clearing was made for the building</span>. <span class="T86">After scanning around,</span> <span class="T86">Graham's attention</span> returned to the <span class="T86">airlock</span> doors of the outpost.</p><p class="P5">The silhouettes of eight <span class="T87">soldiers in armor</span> darkened the twilight gloom of the entryway. Graham stayed back a few steps as the rest of the crew took their positions in the standard entry maneuver. Three went left and three right, <span class="T87">a private</span> stuck to Graham. The two teams went down the short hallways and around the thin wall to the lobby of the installation.</p><p class="P175">Here a pair of staircases led up to the next floor landing, which wrapped the walls. Skylights let in some of the planet's perpetual twilight. The presence of the team caused the recessed lighting to come on. White light flooded the room from a hundred hidden places.</p><p class="P175">Unlike the exterior of the base, everything inside seemed fine. "What a greeting," Graham said to the team. "Anybody home," he <span class="T87">yelled</span>. His voice bounced through the hallways, echoing back.</p><p class="P172">"Shut the fuck up Graham,” The man next to Graham growled in hushed tones. “<span class="T87">You just lost us the element of surprise. </span>One more <span class="T87">crack like that</span> and I'm busting you back down to private." </p><p class="P5">"Copy that, Sergeant.” <span class="T87">Graham's tone became somber and quiet.</span> “Sorry fellas, and my deepest apologies to my viewers at home."</p><p class="P5">"Cut the crap and stay sharp," the Sergeant said. "I want Donovan, Mitchell and O'Connor up top. One room deep, <span class="T87">then I want a</span> report. We'll check out the rest of this floor."</p><p class="P5">The three <span class="T87">soldiers</span> marched up the stairs on the left, executed a room entry at the first door, cleared the room and moved on. The two remaining men led the Sergeant down the hallway on the right at the back of the room. Graham followed, with Private Grady in tow.</p><p class="P5">The corridor lights came on as they swept the hall and the offices around them. Graham looked into every room, each one was neatly kept. Not a pen was out of place. The small team made it to the end of the hallway, marked by the double doors of the research lab. The commanding officer's radio crackled to life. Graham couldn't hear what they said, but the Sergeant ordered the other team to meet them at the lab doors.</p><p class="P5">The whole team gathered around the steel double doors. The Sergeant listened to the other team's report, then motioned the men to prepare for entry. They split up, three to a side once again. The six men crouched, assault rifles ready. Graham and Grady stayed back to get a full view of the entry. </p><p class="P5">The Sergeant gave the signal and the doors flew wide open. As soon as the doors opened, the lights came on. Even as the assault teams made their way across the steel grating and down the pair of staircases to the floor of the lab, Graham's eyes moved to the features that separated this lab from every other XR28 research facility.</p><p class="P175">In the far right corner and along the right wall <span class="T87">there were</span> three round holes w<span class="T87">here the concrete was</span> eaten <span class="T87">away</span>. <span class="T87">They looked large enough that an adult could walk through them.</span> Graham w<span class="T87">alked</span> through the doors and out onto the landing.</p><p class="P175"><span class="T87">Now that he could see the whole room, it was clear some sort of struggle went on here. E</span>quipment <span class="T87">was</span> tossed around, metal shelving units <span class="T87">were</span> dented and toppled. It was clear to anyone looking that this lab was attacked by forces. <span class="T87">Presumably</span> <span class="T87">having</span> entered through th<span class="T87">o</span>se holes.</p><p class="P5">The teams swept the floor, checking each room. They met in the <span class="T87">disheveled space in the</span> middle. <span class="T4">The commanding officer said, “Gannon, McElheny and Donovan, I want a thorough perimeter sweep. O'Connor and Mitchell,” he pointed at the pair of soldiers on his right, “Check those holes. I want to know what's on the other side. Be smart about it. Any sign of trouble and I want you turning tail back here. Plant remote charges when you come, enough to block 'em up if worse comes to worse. Private Grady and I will remain here to secure this room.”</span></p><p class="P145">The Sergeant turned to face Graham. The armor faceplate gave him a predatory grimace. <span class="T88">The helmet was</span> mantis-like with slanted, black lenses. “Graham, I need you to see what's on these computers. Find out what was going on here that brought on this attack.”</p><p class="P145">Graham turned to the nearest terminal and sat down. The sound of muffled orders over crackling radio transmissions passed around Graham unnoticed as he dropped to the command line and began probing through the file tree. He dug through the user logs and pulled up frequently used files.</p><p class="P145">Murphy made the Major stop her report as each new file was displayed. <span class="T89">Loren said nothing, letting the commander absorb the information along with Graham.</span> <span class="T89">Just as she did when she watched the Skald's recording. Murphy was visibly unsettled as he read the files. A picture was forming in his mind, one of disease in his home.</span></p><p class="P147"><span class="T90">Then </span>Graham turned to a set of directories on the main laboratory server <span class="T90">designated</span> eyes only. <span class="T90">He looked at Major Loren and said,</span> “I see why you brought this straight to me, Major. These pages alone indicate research into intelligence computing projects deemed unethical and illegal within the commonwealth. You made the right call.”</p><p class="P146">Loren's <span class="T89">eyebrows pulled tight in a grave expression</span> as she said, “It gets worse, sir.”</p><p class="P146">She advanced the scene and paused it again when Graham pulled up the lab computer's most recent logs. <span class="T89">Among the video clips</span> w<span class="T89">as</span> a series of recordings made by Major Hayden, the lead scientist of the project. These were dated from the first months of the base's establishment <span class="T90">thirty years before</span> to <span class="T90">within ten years ago</span>.</p><p class="P177">“There's twenty years of research,” Graham said, as he played Hayden's first video. “It was the man's life's work... How am I going to skim through this to sort anything out?” </p><p class="P177">Audio came on and Hayden's face appeared in a small window on the screen. Murphy looked from the picture in Hayden's file to the video Graham watched and nodded.</p><p class="P149">“This is the private file of Dr. Erasmus Hayden,” Hayden said. He wore a handsome, honest grin. “Today, I begin my research! I've been waiting for this since my thesis.” Murphy thought the doctor's blue eyes showed a keen intelligence behind them, even though the smile touched their corners.</p><p class="P148">“It doesn't matter that no one will know I got to see it through. The merit is in the research itself. What I'm about to do will change the face of the Commonwealth. <span class="T90">Maybe even the galaxy.</span>” He looked away from the camera for a moment, then back. “At least I hope so. We'll see <span class="T90">what comes in the long run</span>. Turning this dream into reality is going to take patience. Today is <span class="T90">only</span> step one, <span class="T90">S</span>et up. Configure the sims, catalog the hardware, feed the wetware, etc. Not much to say beyond that. The end products will be stored alongside this recording. For whom, I can't say. If most anyone finds this research, I'm cooked. See you tomorrow.”</p><p class="P148">The recording ended and Graham pulled up the next one. It was more of the same. The next day didn't show much new information, so he skipped to the next week.</p><p class="P176">Hayden appeared <span class="T90">again, his complexion paler and there with bags under his eyes</span>. He smiled into the camera. “Today, my future audience, I stand on the threshold of a new frontier. Just three hours ago, we finally integrated the salvaged projects we recovered from the old installation.</p><p class="P176"> Military objective number one satisfied. The new systems accelerated the cortical assignment processes faster than I ever imagined. Some of you may not grasp the significance of this and, since I am a student first, I will provide my posterity with a bit of a background.” He leans in to the desktop camera with a giddy smile, a gleam in his eye. The video recording cuts to a still image of a <span class="T5">pad of tissue</span> <span class="T5">in a petri dish.</span></p><p class="P150">Tiny injectors circled the dish, microscopic chemical dispensers which fed <span class="T91">chemicals</span> into the swirling fluid. A thicket of <span class="T30">mono</span>filament leads ran from the fleshy gray-pink square to a patchwork rig of hardware and a terminal. Hayden's voice came on to explain the image.</p><p class="P150">“This is my project. The one that earned me my commission. The experiment that was the subject of my dissertation. I slogged through a mess of Martingales and plethoras of polypeptides, but I programmed a brain.”</p><p class="P150">The image changed again, back to Hayden's office. Hayden put on a pair of controller lenses and picked up a light pen. He point and swoop with it, activating the the holo display field in the air over his desk, just in front of the camera. The doctor manipulated the control display on the inside of the tinted lenses to bring a high-resolution model of the brain into the view of the camera. Hayden began to draw as he spoke, pulling the camera deep into the neural anatomy of the human brain.</p><p class="P151"> “<span class="T91">Well, what I made was mostly a brain. It was basically a brain. I</span>t's an electro-chemical computer. The neurochemicals attach to cellular receptors, which vary the resistance at the synapse nodes. The cells then produce chemicals which react to the electrical activity, in ripples, patterns that flood the brain. <span class="T91">Sometimes the signal tells the cells to produce somethings else.</span></p><p class="P151">Sometimes <span class="T91">this results in</span> awakening memories, sometimes feelings, a touch, a smell, rage, death, <span class="T91">hope, exhaltation.</span> <span class="T91">T</span>he signals go out through the network, changing it as they pass, producing more ripples as they touch. <span class="T91">100 to 500 trillion</span> <span class="T91">synapses in the brain</span>, exchanging cascades of information between them. </p><p class="P151"><span class="T91">Well, I could only manage to grow half a trillion, but I proved the point.</span> <span class="T91">I unlocked how to orchestrate them. All those</span> cells performing analog operations simultaneously, keeping some in memory, discarding others. All in real time.”</p><p class="P152">The image of the brain faded when Hayden drew an X through it. “What <span class="T91">mind </span>could write a program for such a machine? How d<span class="T91">id</span> the computation begin?” He sat in the chair and looked at the camera. He gave a knowing smile, then brought his index finger to his lips. “Shh…,” he said, then winked. The video ended.</p><p class="P153">Graham <span class="T91">twisted around</span> as the Sergeant <span class="T91">came up</span> behind him. “Sergeant Cooper, sir. It looks like they were experimenting with artificial intelligence. In my opinion the Major was off 'is gourd. <span class="T30">S</span>miles too much. I've been looking through the logs and don't know much yet, but he said something about salvaging the research of the old installation nearby.”</p><p class="P153"><span class="T92">Cooper nodded, </span>“Keep at it Graham. The first team is on the way back, found an arm. They're bringing in for analysis.” <span class="T92">He</span> turned away and spoke over his handheld, “O'Connor and Mitchell return to rendezvous. I want the whole team for this one.”</p><p class="P153">The pair arrived first, just a minute ahead of the trio. McElheny brought up the severed arm, clad in ripped gray sleeve. The fist was closed around a thick strand of something sticky and fibrous.</p><p class="P153">“Looks like he's holding a rope made of hair,” said Gannon. She took off her helmet to get a look at it with her naked eyes. She poked the white mass with her index finger, then rubbed the wispy frayed end between her thumb and forefinger. “I think it's silk. A spiderweb?”</p><p class="P154">“Big ass spider,” <span class="T10">said Graham.</span></p><p class="P154">“Great,” said Cooper.</p><p class="P153"> </p><p class="P178"><span class="T102">S</span><span class="T101">o Where Were The Spiders?</span></p><p class="P133">“Graham, see what you can make of the silk. <span class="T92">Keep sifting through that research</span>. I need as much information as you can get by the next time the teams return,” said Cooper. “I want Donovan, Mitchell, O'Connor and Gannon <span class="T6">walking guard duty in pairs. Cover from the entrance to here and drop sentry packs where it makes sense.” </span></p><p class="P7">The four soldiers shot to their feet and went about executing their orders. “McElheny, Grady,” Cooper continued, “Rearrange the furniture in here for optimal defensible positions, just in case. Slide some racks in front of those holes for starters. I want all teams back in three hours to eat.” </p><p class="P7">The team went about their work. Every once in a while, Graham looked up from the screens of lab reports and research notes to see how Grady and McElheny were <span class="T7">coming with their project. He could hear the unintelligibly faint murmur of Cooper's voice, composing a report to his superior officers. </span></p><p class="P9">Murphy stopped the recording again.</p><p class="P6"><span class="T7">He turned to look at Loren, sitting across the table. </span>“<span class="T7">Major, do we have a copy of Cooper's report?”</span></p><p class="P6">“<span class="T7">No, sir,” the Major replied, “the Skald's black box is the only piece of information we have regarding this incident at Phobos.”</span></p><p class="P8">Murphy nodded grimly. His gears were turning, but the Major could not guess what he was thinking. He resumed the playback.</p><p class="P8">“I've bookmarked the end of this portion, sir,” Major Loren said. “If you advance the feed, it will pick up when the squad meets for rations. Nothing significant happens in the mean time.”</p><p class="P8">“Thank you for your forethought, Major,” Murphy said and took the Major's advice. The recording jumped to a scene of the squad sitting around on supply crates, eating and discussing their observations about the facility since their last meeting.</p><p class="P170"><span class="T13">Cooper said, “</span><span class="T22">Now that everyone's had a chance to </span><span class="T13">tour the exotic Phobos station, I want candid opinions. We'll start on my left and work around the circle, ending with our most sagacious </span><span class="T15">Specialist</span><span class="T13"> Graham.” He smiled at his own cleverness. “Donovan, you're up.”</span></p><p class="P169"><span class="T13">Donovan wore her </span><span class="T26">hair in a buzz all around. </span><span class="T27">T</span><span class="T26">he top </span><span class="T27">was grown out, a swoop on both sides ending in</span><span class="T13"> </span><span class="T14">black</span><span class="T13"> </span><span class="T26">bangs </span><span class="T27">which hung</span><span class="T26"> down</span><span class="T14"> to just above her jaw. </span><span class="T26">Her dark hair</span><span class="T14"> and pale complexion made the green of her eyes dramatic. </span><span class="T22">Colorful, jagged tattoos swept down her scalp to just below her hairline and came up around her neck from below the collar of her armor.</span><span class="T14"> “The place is </span><span class="T27">wrong</span><span class="T14">, sir. I'm looking forward to being gone. Gannon and I saw signs of a false wall in Hayden's office. We made sure to set up a sentry there, in case we get visitor</span><span class="T15">s</span><span class="T14">.”</span></p><p class="P8"><span class="T8">Cooper asked, </span>“<span class="T8">What do you mean by signs?”</span></p><p class="P8">“<span class="T93">There were scrape marks on the floor leading to the wall, then they disappeared. We didn't try to open it. We thought we'd wait to tell you first.”</span></p><p class="P8">“<span class="T9">Alright, bring up the sentry network on your hand-helds,” the Sergeant said. He went to an equipment case and opened it. Cooper handed Mitchell another of the thin, palm sized computers from among the gear within. “That goes for everyone.”</span></p><p class="P10">Each soldier pressed a few buttons on their terminals and brought up the cameras they positioned throughout the installation. When they were through, Copper said, “Alright. O'Connor. You're up.” <span class="T10">He turned to look at the man with the knot-work tattooed down his neck.</span></p><p class="P10">O'Connor <span class="T10">said, “Yes sir. My personal impression is that we should be out of here. A-S-A-F-P. We went deeper into the facility with the second sweep. Everything everywhere, other than in this room, looks untouched. It's like the place is waiting, like the offices are a front for something going on hidden deeper within. You know I'll follow you as long as you want to stay here, Sarge, but I want us gone as soon as we find what we need. Hopefully we won't see any sign of whatever made that silk cord.”</span></p><p class="P10">“<span class="T10">Sentiments noted, Corporal. We're in agreement,” Cooper said. “We'll withdraw at the earliest possible convenience. All right, Gannon. What have you seen?”</span></p><p class="P10">“<span class="T10">I'm with O'Connor,” she said. “I don't like this waiting and I want to get out of here. I don't care if I get a minute of sleep, as long as it means we get out of here soon. I'm curious, though. I want to take a couple soldiers to find out what's behind that door. I want to know what they were doing here to make the Gaians interested in this outpost in the first place.” She brushed a wisp of chestnut bangs back behind her ear. They were the longest part of her hair, which was buzzed around the sides and back, leaving her a crown of disheveled spikes.</span></p><p class="P10">“<span class="T11">Thank you, Corporal. Your suggestion for further recon is denied for the evening. We will scour the rest of the facility at first light. Go, Mitchell.”</span></p><p class="P10"><span class="T11">Mitchell said, “I don't know what more I have to add to the discussion. Wait… I didn't mention it at first, but when O'Connor and I were rigging the tunnels, I saw some more of that silky stuff. I remember the smell of vinegar in there as </span><span class="T11">well. I just assumed the silky stuff was some kind of fungus or mold giving off that smell. I remember there were these grooves, too. Deep, like someone was dragging a pair of hunting knives in each hand as they wiggled their way down. Aside from that, there was a heap of goo. It's in the tunnel on the right. Again, I assumed it was fungus. The more I think about it… maybe it's more of the leavings of whatever made that silk rope. Also, something else is bothering me about that arm. Where's the rest of the man who's missing it?” Mitchell looked down at the floor and sniffed.</span></p><p class="P11">Cooper said, “I want you to go and get that <span class="T93">glob from the tunnel</span> before we turn in, Private. Switch your hand-held to bio-lume and record any signs of blood or tissue on the way there and back. Grady and M<span class="T106">cElheny</span> will help you open the way back up. Let's hear your thoughts, PFC M<span class="T106">cElheny</span>.”</p><p class="P11">“Well, sir. I was surprised at how clean it was where we found that arm. There weren't any signs of struggle that I could make out, but I did notice the tissue around the shoulder where the arm was severed looked to be cooked some, like chemical burns. <span class="T93">I'll bet the burns have</span> to do with the vinegar smell.”</p><p class="P11">“I guess we'll find out Private,” Cooper said. “Though if we're lucky, we may not have to. Okay, Grady. What do you have for us?”</p><p class="P11">“Nothing to report that hasn't been addressed by the others, sir,” said Grady.</p><p class="P11">“This is your first time out with the squad, so I'll let it slide tonight. However, you're first tomorrow night. I want to hear your thoughts, Grady. Make sure you have some,” Cooper finished. He turned to Graham. “Let's have it, <span class="T31">Graham.</span>”</p><p class="P15">“I haven't been able to find much specific to what kind of research was going on before Hayden got here. His logs and notes might as well be coded, for all the sense I can make of them. He philosophizes and pontificates about intelligence and computing, but I can't find anything on the main lab servers or the private one <span class="T93">that sum up what they were into</span>. <span class="T93">All I have are hints from research reports.</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T93">I detected</span> a smaller network of systems that I can't get access to. <span class="T93">They seem to be on a different level of the base.</span> If the main net ever could <span class="T93">connect to them</span>, the <span class="T93">systems up here</span> <span class="T93">c</span>an't <span class="T93">anymore</span>. I'll have to be in front of th<span class="T93">ose</span> machines to interface with them. Trouble is, I've been racking my brain to think of where they could be in this building, but I can't come up with a physical place <span class="T93">where they should be</span>. Now that Donovan mentioned the false wall, my gut's tellin' me that's our ticket.”</p><p class="P12">Cooper nodded, then asked, “What about the research? <span class="T32">Is</span> Hayden talking about spiders? Do we know if the Commonwealth is responsible for <span class="T32">what happened here</span>?”</p><p class="P12"><span class="T32">Graham replied, </span>“The only mention of anything about spiders is a four month block of notes related to <span class="T32">the synthesis of new artificial polymers based off of studies of spidroin 1 and 2, the main components of spider silk. One describes the alignment and self-assembly process of the proteins in natural subjects, which is as direct a reference to the presence of arachnids in this base as I could find.”</span></p><p class="P12">“<span class="T32">So that rope of silk we found with the severed arm might be man-made…,” McElheny blurted.</span></p><p class="P12">“<span class="T32">Cool it, soldier,” Sergeant Cooper said. “Save the comments until Graham's done.”</span></p><p class="P12"><span class="T32">Graham continued, </span>“<span class="T32">I agree with the rest of the squad, the sooner we're out of here the better. I am sure that the answers we need to move on are nowhere in this building, Sarge. We gotta see where those tunnels lead and what that false wall is covering. I need to track down those servers.”</span></p><p class="P13">“<span class="T32">Agreed,” said Cooper. “Ok, troops. That's it for today. It's time for some R&amp;R. McElheny, you're on first watch. Then Gannon, then Grady. Three hour rotation. Mind those sentries. Mitchell, take Grady and Graham to retrieve your glob from that tunnel.”</span></p><p class="P25">The four men broke away. McElheny went off to make his rounds, every few seconds he dragged a finger across the screen of his hand-held, monitoring the feeds from the different sentry packs. Graham followed Grady and Mitchell to the rightmost tunnel. Graham and Grady moved the rack in front of the hole, which was maybe a half-meter in diameter.</p><p class="P25"> Mitchell pulled out his hand-held and tapped a few times at the screen, then looked at the other two. “Be right back guys,” he whispered. Then Mitchell put on his helmet and crawled in. </p><p class="P25">Graham waited a few seconds to look in after him. Mitchell was making quick progress. Graham could see the flashing red light of the first explosive charge just behind the man in the hole.</p><p class="P14">“<span class="T33">Hey guys,” Mitchell called back. “The scanner is picking up blood soaked into the dirt all the way down the tunnel.” He continued crawling in silence.</span></p><p class="P16">A few minutes later, Mitchell returned. He crawled out of the tunnel, brushing dirt off as he stood <span class="T94">up</span>. Cooper came up to them without a word and held out his hand.  Mitchell was familiar with the drill and gave Cooper the handheld. Then, he pulled a clear bag from his large, right knee pocket.</p><p class="P16">Within was a gelatinous translucent glob. <span class="T94">It</span> flu<span class="T34">o</span>res<span class="T34">c</span>ed <span class="T34">blue when the light on Mitchell's mask passed over it. Cooper took this as well. He tucked the bag under his arm, then waved for the men to return the rack to its place. When the tunnel was covered once more, he waved them back to the circle of their camp.</span></p><p class="P17">They set the bag aside and went to sleep. Graham watched Sergeant Cooper for a moment as he looked over the data in the handheld. Graham rolled over and went to sleep.</p><p class="P17"> </p><p class="P155">Donovan's Wall</p><p class="P17">The next morning, Cooper heard the reports from the watch. No activity on any shift. “The less we see, the more I become convinced,” Donovan said. “The place is waiting, I can feel it.”</p><p class="P17">“Waiting for what? We couldn't be in a better place for whatever might be waiting to drop the roof on us,” said Mitchell. “Why didn't they, or it, strike last night?”</p><p class="P17">“Maybe we're too ready,” <span class="T35">said O'Connor. “Like they're waiting for us to let our guard down.”</span></p><p class="P18">Gannon said, ”Maybe we're doing exactly what they want?”</p><p class="P18">“<span class="T94">We can guess 'til we're blue in the face</span>,” barked Cooper. “We simply don't know and it's up to us to find out. We'll go ahead as planned. Gannon and O'Connor, <span class="T39">you're on sentry patrol</span>. Graham <span class="T39">and Grady</span>, <span class="T39">stay back</span>. I want you to study that glob in the bag. Use the scanner and whatever else is in this lab. I want to know as much as we can by the end of the day. The rest of us will check out Donovan's false wall. Bring the trap rigs and two more sentries.”</p><p class="P18">The four soldiers looked through the gear until they found the necessary equipment and went off after the Sergeant. Graham raised the bag up in front of him, then turned to put it between him and an overhead light. The glob was clearly some kind of tissue, a ragged chunk by the look of it. It was less translucent than the jellyfish from home. <span class="T94">H</span>e could see some veins in the very surface of the blob, but no other complicated anatomy. He turned it a little bit and admired the blue sheen the light gave it.</p><p class="P18">“Aren't you a beauty. I hope the rest of you is as pleasant,” Graham said under his breath.</p><p class="P19">He broke out the handheld and activated the scanning function, then passed the beam over the glob in the bag. “Grady,” he shouted as he looked over the readout. “We're going to th<span class="T94">e</span> lab across the way.”</p><p class="P19">Graham led Grady into a small laboratory geared for medical, judging by the instruments. Grady said, “You know how to use this stuff?”</p><p class="P20">Graham scoffed as he set the bag down on a table next to a large molecular <span class="T36">scan-modeler.</span> “'course I do.” He reached up to get a large glass petri dish from the cabinet. “We aren't performing DNA therapy or even a bypass surgery. <span class="T37">This is j</span>ust a basic lab exercise.” He washed up and put on gloves, then put the blob in the dish. The dish went into the <span class="T94">M</span>.<span class="T94">S</span>.<span class="T94">M</span>. machine.</p><p class="P20">Graham took off his gloves, then pressed some buttons on the control panel. “Now we wait.”</p><p class="P21">In a couple minutes they had a complete model of the blob rendered by the computer. A plethora of information about the sample was presented along side the picture of the finished model on the screen. Graham brought out Mitchell's hand-held and transferred the information generated by the scanner. As it transferred, he paged through some of the results.</p><p class="P21">“Seems this thing has fibers of platinum built into its tissues,” Graham said. “Nerves, blood vessels, all the cells have it, but only some are hooked up. I've never heard of anything like this, but I <span class="T94">pay more attention to tech</span> than bio. <span class="T38">Does it mean anything to you?</span>”</p><p class="P21">“<span class="T38">Not really. But, I barely passed the physical sciences,” Grady said. “</span>Why'd they make it illegal? <span class="T38">A.I. research, I mean.”</span></p><p class="P21">“<span class="T38">There was a series of problems. All kinds of things went wrong,” Graham said. “Never managed a good application for what we had, maybe. I'm not sure about the particulars.”</span></p><p class="P22">Mitchell's pad confirmed the successful transfer of the information. Graham unhooked it, then pulled another petri dish from the shelves. This one with a shallow layer of nutrient agar on the bottom. He took a small blade from the drawer in the bench and cut a tiny sliver from the bulbous end of the glob. He put it on the petri dish, which he then put in a microscope fitted for the dish.</p><p class="P22">Graham flipped a switch and a light came on underneath, along with the view screen. The zoomed image showed the cells closest to the agar along the sample's right side. He took out Mitchell's handheld and took a picture of the screen.</p><p class="P22">“Okay, we'll check on it in a couple hours. Meantime, we'll throw the bag in the freezer. Just in case.” Graham walked to the small cabinet and opened the polished metal door. A fog curled out onto the white lacquered floor. “Good, still frosty.” He put the dish with the blob in the freezer and closed it. “Let's get back to camp.”</p><p class="P22">When they got back, Graham went through lab records for a few more minutes, until Cooper and the others returned. <span class="T95">Cooper arrived first. He pushed a button on his hand-held, “Everybody bring it in, on the double.” He addressed the soldiers in the room. “I'll save the briefing for when we're all here. Graham, what did you find?”</span></p><p class="P22">“<span class="T39">It's all on the pad, sir.” He passed Cooper the hand-held containing the model.  “I've got a sample in a dish to see if it will make a culture. The rest is in deep freeze.”</span></p><p class="P22">“<span class="T39">Thank you, Specialist.” Cooper took the pad and reviewed the scan while they waited for the two absent guards.</span></p><p class="P23">Gannon came in from the front, where she'd been patrolling and monitoring the sentry packs. O'Connor came in from the opposite side, a couple minutes behind her. Cooper stood up as O'Connor hustled in.</p><p class="P24">“<span class="T95">Now that we're all here, I'll fill you in. </span>There was a stairway behind the wall Donovan noticed. We found a blast door at the bottom, of a design not Gaian in origin. We were able to get it open, but did not proceed with the search. I've decided that we're moving on. <span class="T40">We'll proceed as a unit.</span></p><p class="P134">Graham's analysis of the tissue sample tells us it's fairly standard organic. It should burn from a plasma shot no problem. If we find any hostiles, standard rifles should do the trick.” Cooper looked around at the troops. Graham did as well, each wore an expression of uncertainty. </p><p class="P134">“I know it's a small comfort,” Cooper said. “That's why we're all going down there together. Let's pack up and move out.”</p><p class="P157"><span class="T17">In a few minutes, t</span><span class="T12">he squad </span><span class="T17">was</span><span class="T12"> gathered around the stairway. Graham looked to his right. The wall across from the office desk was transparent from this side, giving a slightly tinted view of the </span><span class="T23">landscape</span><span class="T12"> surrounding the station.</span></p><p class="P157"><span class="T12">“</span><span class="T23">The s</span><span class="T12">econd moon is in eclipse, Graham said </span><span class="T23">to no one in particular</span><span class="T12">. “It'd be gorgeous if it didn't send shivers down my spine.”</span></p><p class="P156"><span class="T12">Wind kicked up chalk, which flowed over the </span><span class="T16">open ground</span><span class="T12"> in low wisps. </span><span class="T16">A forest of</span><span class="T12"> </span><span class="T16">g</span><span class="T12">narled trees </span><span class="T16">ringed the vast clearing</span><span class="T12">, their bare limbs </span><span class="T23">were</span><span class="T12"> like black </span><span class="T23">claws</span><span class="T12"> </span><span class="T23">reaching up to</span><span class="T12"> the bloody, </span><span class="T23">bruised</span><span class="T12"> </span><span class="T23">flesh of the</span><span class="T12"> sky. High overhead, a halo of golden light crept around the black disc of nothingness that threatened to descend </span><span class="T23">on them</span><span class="T12">.</span></p><p class="P26">He shivered and turned back to the stairs. “Not much cheerier <span class="T96">out</span> there <span class="T96">or in here,</span> is it?”</p><p class="P158"><span class="T12">“</span><span class="T23">Shut it, Graham,” Cooper said. He stepped back as Donovan and McElheny swung the panel out of the wall.</span></p><p class="P158"><span class="T23">Beyond was</span><span class="T12"> a deep cavern. Red lights hung from the rusted frame of </span><span class="T23">a military grade staircase</span><span class="T12">, lighting the grating of the steps and the short walkway halfway down. All Graham could see was the steps, the rest of the cavern was lost in darkness. </span><span class="T23">He flipped on the</span><span class="T12"> light </span><span class="T23">at</span><span class="T12"> the end of his rifle </span><span class="T23">and scanned the room. The beam</span><span class="T12"> played along the </span><span class="T17">limestone floor, but the walls and ceiling were lost </span><span class="T23">beyond its reach</span><span class="T17">. The only feature was the door, a thick metal bulkhead set into a ten foot slope of white stone </span><span class="T23">at the very bottom of the chamber</span><span class="T17">.</span></p><p class="P27">They made their way down the stairs. The whole works creaked and swayed under their w<span class="T96">eigh</span>t. <span class="T96">They didn't speak as they made their way down</span>, <span class="T96">there was only the sound of boots on metal until</span> the soldiers gathered around the ancient door.</p><p class="P28">Cooper gave the signal to Gannon, who spun the wheel and opened the bulkhead. She <span class="T97">grunted as she</span> pulled the hatch aside on its hinges. Donovan and Mitchell tossed a pair of <span class="T97">spherical</span> A/V drones through. Graham watched the<span class="T97">ir</span> feed on his handheld.</p><p class="P159"><span class="T18">The sensor drones </span><span class="T24">floated</span><span class="T18"> down another short set of steps into a dark room. Graham switched the control to low-light vision. The image widened as the orbs </span><span class="T24">drifted</span><span class="T18"> apart. The leftmost stopped on one of the many piles of dirt that covered the laminated tile floor</span><span class="T17">, </span><span class="T18">leaving only patches of the green and white checker pattern visible.</span></p><p class="P160"><span class="T18">W</span><span class="T12">hen the right drone came to a stop, the machines began to calculate. Graham moved his fingers on the screen to turn the cameras. Measurements of distance scrolled down the right side of the screen as the computers drew wire shapes around the objects in the room.</span></p><p class="P29">Graham leaned over to Cooper and whispered, “Looks to be a forty by sixty room. The ceiling is collapsed, burying about the far left third of the room. There's a door on the right of the far wall, personnel sized. Also a double door on the right wall, maybe ten feet down. There's another double door buried under the dirt, maybe five feet left of the <span class="T97">personell</span> on the far wall. The hole in the roof looks like it might lead to open air. No signs of life. It looks like there might be buried lab furniture, but the computer doesn't show anything certain. <span class="T97">No signs of power, electrical or otherwise.</span>”</p><p class="P29">Cooper pointed to O'Connor and Mitchell. “Low-light, far wall right side.” They pressed buttons on the sides of their visors, then raised their rifles. The Sergeant stepped silently over to Gannon and McElheny, “Low-light, left side sweep.” They also switched their masks and fell in behind O'Connor and Mitchell.</p><p class="P29">Cooper motioned to the first pair to go. “Fan out,” he said to the other soldiers. He motioned for Gannon and McElheny to go, then went in himself. Donovan followed, then Grady, then Graham. </p><p class="P30">The soldiers swept through the room, vigilant and silent. <span class="T97">Their knees were bent and their rifles were ready as they moved with purpose to their assigned doors.</span> Graham looked at the walls as the four <span class="T97">leading</span> soldiers wound their way around the piles of earth to the double doors. Periodically his head would turn from his path to mark the progress of the others working their way along the walls.</p><p class="P30">Grady was five feet to his right. Graham saw the younger man go around a pile of filth toward Cooper. As he passed out of sight, <span class="T97">Grady</span> whispered, “Hey.”</p><p class="P30">Graham stopped and slowly turned in his direction. He came around the dirt to find Grady kneeling to look at something on the ground. Graham said,“What?”</p><p class="P30">Grady looked up, resting and elbow and his rifle on his left thigh. He pointed at a thin membrane of grayish tissue. Graham knelt to look <span class="T97">more closely</span>.</p><p class="P30">He poked it with a gloved finger. It gave easily, but swelled back up almost instantly. The mass moved a little, just a ripple at the edges, then was still. Graham got up and pulled Grady up with him, then pointed at Cooper's back. He went back around the left side of the mound.</p><p class="P161"><span class="T12"> </span><span class="T19">Graham looked left as he came around, spotting Gannon and McElheny as they passed by the drone. Gannon bent to p</span><span class="T24">luck</span><span class="T19"> it </span><span class="T24">out of the air where it hovered</span><span class="T19">. She put the ball in her pocket, but looked at something on the ground for a few moments longer. “Looks like </span><span class="T24">she's found some as well</span><span class="T19">,” Graham murmured. She stood back up and Graham turned away.</span></p><p class="P31">He came to another tall heap of dirt. This one showed the side of a metal bookshelf which provided <span class="T97">the pile</span> its structure. Graham went right.</p><p class="P31">From his left came a rustling noise. Graham turned to see the wall of dirt come alive. Gannon and McElheny stopped and raised their guns. O'Connor and Mitchell started running over from the door nearby. Gannon shouted over the radio, “Sir, something is moving in the dirt pile over here!”</p><p class="P31">The wall seemed to be shaking apart. Dirt rained down from half a dozen holes as something burrowed toward them. Black mandibles, <span class="T97">shaped</span> more like scoops than claws, chewed through <span class="T97">the dirt.</span> <span class="T97">F</span>ollow<span class="T97">ing the mandibles into the room were</span> flat white heads. <span class="T97">After their heads came a p</span>air of long, <span class="T97">spindly</span> l<span class="T97">imbs</span>, <span class="T97">which felt</span> the way for the rest of <span class="T97">the body</span>. A handful of eyes sat on the slope<span class="T97">d head</span> just above the creatures' mouth. Fat, bone-white, cockroach bodies crept <span class="T97">into the room</span> on <span class="T97">three pairs of squat insect </span>legs. Dragging behind each one was a tail tipped with <span class="T97">a triple</span> barb like a fishing spear.</p><p class="P31">The <span class="T97">scorpion creatures</span> shook the dirt off, <span class="T97">their carapaces rattling,</span> as they crawled down the slope to the floor. Some headed for Gannon and McElheny, some for O'Connor and Mitchell. As they got closer, the tails came up <span class="T98">ready to strike</span>.</p><p class="P162"><span class="T12">Gannon stepped aside, leaving McElheny </span><span class="T20">enough room to get away from the wall. The creature turned toward her as she raised her gun to her shoulder. McElheny did the same.</span></p><p class="P163"><span class="T20">S</span><span class="T12">he stepped to the side and back, then fired. A white flash filled Graham's vision. The visor slowly compensated, dulling the flash so that he could see </span><span class="T25">Gannon's</span><span class="T12"> shadow moving behind it.</span></p><p class="P32">“Flares!” Sergeant Cooper shouted over the radio. Five spots of light appeared in the dimness. They swelled until the room was filled with a decent glow. Graham could see the upturned body of Gannon's first attacker five feet in front of her. She was currently backing away from a second, which flailed its long front legs at her. She ducked a stab from its tail and put a shot through the thing's black pearl eyes. </p><p class="P164"><span class="T12">Behind her, closer to the wall, M</span><span class="T25">cElheny</span><span class="T12"> took a </span><span class="T25">blow</span><span class="T12"> from his </span><span class="T25">attacker</span><span class="T12">'s front leg and went down. He fired twice and missed the monster's head, but the triple barbed head of its tail exploded into chunks of gray goo on the second shot. </span><span class="T21">The creature crawled over McElheny and opened its mandibles. Fluid sprayed </span><span class="T25">from its mouth</span><span class="T21"> </span><span class="T25">o</span><span class="T21">nto the soldier's </span><span class="T25">helmet</span><span class="T21"> and down </span><span class="T25">into</span><span class="T21"> his </span><span class="T25">armor</span><span class="T21">. </span></p><p class="P33">“Ugh!” He cried. McElheny grabbed the knife from his belt then drove it home through the creature's mouth. He wiped the gunk from his <span class="T99">facemask</span> and flung it to the floor. An instant later the rifle was back up and McElheny put a plasma round through the scorpion's head. He picked up his knife and Graham turned away <span class="T99">to look at</span> the other pair closest to the <span class="T99">monsters</span>.</p><p class="P33"> Cooper and Grady were already there. O'Connor was lying on the ground <span class="T99">n</span>earest them. Graham rushed over to help.</p><p class="P33">Cooper and Mitchell took turns missing as one of the scorpions dodged aside. Graham rushed past them toward Grady. <span class="T99">The private's</span> foe was pressing him back <span class="T99">as</span> <span class="T99">it </span>stepp<span class="T99">ed</span> around his shots. Grady was to occupied with dodging the tail to aim. Neither saw Graham approach. <span class="T99">The technician</span> raised <span class="T99">his</span> rifle and blasted the monster in the torso. A chunk blew out of its right side, along with two <span class="T99">of its</span> center legs. It turned to face Graham, further exposing its wounded parts. Graham stilled it with another plasma round. </p><p class="P33">He turned to see Cooper and Mitchell's spider was dead now as well. Cooper hit the radio button on his handheld. He said, “Gannon get over here. O'Connor's in trouble.”</p><p class="P33">She came back, “Sarge, McElheny has been hit with a liquid of some kind. I think it's digestive fluids. <span class="T100">The stuff</span> smells like vinegar. It<span class="T100">'s eaten through his helmet and it</span> looks like the skin is starting to burn.”</p><p class="P33">Cooper said, ”Understood. <span class="T100">Get over here</span> <span class="T100">o</span>n the double, Gannon.”</p><p class="P33">“Yes sir,” she said. A few seconds later she arrived and knelt by O'Connor's lifeless form.</p><p class="P33">After a quick once over, she looked at Cooper. “He's unconscious. We've got to get him and McElheny back to safety.”</p><p class="P33">“Agreed,” said Cooper. “Mitchell, go help Gannon get McElheny. Grady, you and I will take O'Connor. Donovan leads us back. Graham, you follow up the rear and cover us.”</p><p class="P34">The team made its way back to the bulk head. As they were filing out, the caved in <span class="T100">mound of</span> dirt began to s<span class="T100">h</span>ake <span class="T100">loose</span> again. Graham said, “More of those scorpion things are coming through. Hurry up.” He lined up a shot and stopped one before it <span class="T100">could dig itself out</span>. </p><p class="P34">They had Mitchell through and Grady was starting to lead O'Connor <span class="T100">past</span> the bulkhead when the first pair of creatures broke <span class="T100">into the room</span>. He took one before it could cross half the distance. The other went unharmed amidst his careful fire and was near enough to lunge its tail at Graham in a split second.</p><p class="P34">The soldier's honed reflexes saved him. Graham ducked then shot the monster in the head. Two more were right behind it, but Cooper used his right hand to take some pot shots with his rifle as he led the injured soldier through the door.  He lamed one <span class="T100">of the scorpions</span>, but neither he or Graham managed to kill another of the<span class="T100">m</span>.</p><p class="P34">When he was through, Cooper shouted, “Come On!” Graham fired wildly as he backed <span class="T100">out.</span> <span class="T100">H</span>e didn<span class="T100">'</span>t stop shooting until Donovan slammed the bulkhead shut.</p><p class="P34">“Alright, lets head back to the lab. Graham, Grady and Donovan; I want you to make sure two more sentry packs are on this door before you come back. Booby trap it, too. I want this room secure.” <span class="T100">He took another look at the injured soldiers. “Shit,” he said, “What a disaster.”</span> He waved for the rest of them to start the grueling trek up the stairs, <span class="T100">carrying</span> their wounded comrades.</p><p class="P34"> </p><p class="P165">Changes</p><p class="P35">They could hear the scorpions tapping against the door as they made their way up the rickety staircase. The sentry packs were set by the time the wounded were clear of the stairs. Graham looked back every once in while on his way up, but the big metal door showed no signs of giving any time soon. He Grady and Donovan made their way to the center of operations.</p><p class="P35">M<span class="T104">cElheny</span> was sitting on a crate, <span class="T104">body swaying slightly as if he were dazed.</span> Gannon hover<span class="T104">ed</span> in front of him, examining his eyes. In her hand was a bottle of drops, which she set down on the crate next to M<span class="T104">cElheny</span> among the gauze and other first aid supplies. O'Connor was lying on his back, on the ground to M<span class="T104">cElheny's</span> left. </p><p class="P36">Cooper came up to them, but Graham kept walking toward O'Connor. He over heard Sergeant Cooper saying, “Donovan.”</p><p class="P36">“Sir,” she replied. “The packs are operational and the<span class="T103">re's no sign they'll get through the door anytime soon</span>.”</p><p class="P36"><span class="T103">Cooper said, </span>“Thank you, Donovan. You and Grady walk the front of the installation. Keep the <span class="T103">feeds from the</span> sentries looping on your terminals.”</p><p class="P36"><span class="T103">Donovan said, </span>“Sir?”.</p><p class="P36">“Yes, Corporal”, <span class="T103">he said.</span></p><p class="P36">“How are M<span class="T105">cElheny</span> and O'Connor?”</p><p class="P36"><span class="T104">Graham looked at McElheny for a few seconds. The skin around his eyes was livid purple. Everything between his scalp and chin was beginning to swell, but the eyes were the worst. The rest was normal flesh tone, but populated with corroded marks. </span>The trio walked into Graham's view. Cooper said, “Well, Gannon? How is he?”</p><p class="P142"><span class="T41">Gannon stood up from her examination of M</span><span class="T44">cElheny</span><span class="T41">'s burns and faced the Sergeant. “He's temporarily blind. I'll have to run some analysis on the venom, but it looks like there's at least</span><span class="T44"> very concentrated</span><span class="T41"> acetic acid in it. That's why it smells the way it does. From what </span><span class="T44">McElheny's behavior</span><span class="T41"> tells me, it also </span><span class="T44">contains</span><span class="T41"> some kind of psychotropic substance. He's not responding to pain, so at least he didn't feel </span><span class="T44">the burns</span><span class="T41">. </span><span class="T44">His chest got it worst.</span><span class="T41"> It's pretty strong stuff, but I flushed it and </span><span class="T42">found something to neutralize the </span><span class="T44">reaction with his skin</span><span class="T42">. Now he's just got to heal. I found some meds </span><span class="T44">in the lab</span><span class="T42"> that should speed </span><span class="T44">his recovery nicely.</span><span class="T42">”</span></p><p class="P37">M<span class="T105">cElheny</span> sighed with relief. “Thanks, miss. I knew it would be nice out today.” He gave a grin <span class="T105">of content relief</span>.</p><p class="P37">Cooper frowned and put a hand on his shoulder, “You with us M<span class="T104">cElheny</span>?”</p><p class="P37">“Oh, yes! You know I've always wanted to go.” H<span class="T104">is</span> face lit up with delight, then fell <span class="T104">into sorrow</span>. “But, I can't afford the ticket. <span class="T104">My dad never gave me</span> my allowance.”</p><p class="P37">Gannon cleared her throat. “That's the dissociative effects of the psychotropic talking.” She fought off a tiny smile that threatened the edges of her mouth.</p><p class="P37">Cooper gave a short laugh. “He's lit. Gannon, will you secure him until he rides this out?”</p><p class="P37">“Yes, sir,” she said. <span class="T45">Gannon put a hand on his shoulder and said, “Okay, we're gonna get up and turn around. I'll help you, alright?”</span></p><p class="P38">“<span class="T45">Okay, movin' now...”, McElheny replied in a distant voice.</span></p><p class="P135">Gannon helped him to his feet and turned him toward the staircase. Graham watched as they made their way to one of the smaller offices on the second floor. As Gannon helped Mitchell navigate the stairs, Cooper knelt down to look at O'Connor. Graham looked down as well. </p><p class="P39">Cooper said, “The barbs are gone.” He ran a gloved finger around the rips in the armor <span class="T105">chestplate</span>, pushing the fabric aside. A gray fuzz grew over the wounds, but there was no sign of the barbs. “I think they've grown into his chest.”</p><p class="P39">Graham said, “His breathing looks really shallow.” Graham pressed a few buttons on his handheld to bring up the squad vitals <span class="T105">monitor</span>. He tapped on O'Connor's name, filling the screen with an active stream of information from his military implants.</p><p class="P39">“<span class="T105">H</span>e's nearly comatose,” Graham said.</p><p class="P40">“Gannon, report back on the double,” Cooper said to his handheld. “We might be losing O'Connor. ”</p><p class="P39">Gannon's voice came back over the radio, “On my way, sir.”</p><p class="P39">Graham helped Cooper get O'Connor's combat armor off. Gannon arrived as Cooper was pulling O'Connor's right arm free of it's sleeve. She examined the wounds.</p><p class="P40">Cooper <span class="T105">told her</span>, “I think the scorpion tail turned into th<span class="T105">at </span>gray <span class="T105">fuzz</span>.”</p><p class="P39">Gannon <span class="T105">cut </span>O'Connor's undershirt <span class="T105">down the middle</span>. The flesh all around the wounds was blotched with a pink rash. The wounds themselves were a bright, bloody pink. She scraped a sample of the tissue a<span class="T105">t</span> the edge of the wound along with some of the gray fibers and took it to the scanner/modeler. Graham trotted to catch up, “I <span class="T105">just</span> remembered. I have <span class="T105">an</span> experiment to look in on.”</p><p class="P41">Gannon put the sample in a petri dish and put it in the scanner. Graham went to the incubator case. He opened the door. Every shelf and surface was completely overgrown with gray fungus. Mats of it coated the walls and stalactites of it hung from the roof.</p><p class="P41">There was a newly forming bulb of bluish gray tissue, <span class="T105">about ten centimeters across,</span> in the petri dish where the culture began. Graham leaned forward. The musty fungus smell was nearly strong enough to choke him, but curiosity brought him in closer. The mass quivered and pulsed, <span class="T105">swelling</span> <span class="T105">larger with each pulse</span>. As he leaned in, he could see faint traces of blue sparks, running through the translucent tissue.</p><p class="P41">He stared a few seconds, <span class="T105">transfixed by it</span>, until Gannon called <span class="T105">out</span>. “Graham!” He stood back from the incubator and turned to her. “Yes,” <span class="T105">he said.</span></p><p class="P44">“I'm all done with the sample. It's a match for the first one you made,” Gannon <span class="T105">said. She</span> came over to look at the incubator as she finished s<span class="T105">peaking.</span></p><p class="P44">“What <span class="T105">the hell is that</span>?” <span class="T106">Gannon whispered.</span> <span class="T106">She </span>star<span class="T106">ed</span> agape at the infested incubator and the pulsing bulb of the tissue in the petri dish.</p><p class="P41">“Trouble,” <span class="T106">Graham said.</span> “No doubt about it.” He turned to look at the incubator, too. “I need Mitchell's handheld.”</p><p class="P41">Gannon passed it to hi<span class="T107">m</span>.</p><p class="P42">“Convenient you had that,” Graham said. <span class="T46">He keyed in the commands that brought up the recording and scanning functions to document this new addition to the mission report.</span></p><p class="P42">“<span class="T46">It's the most complete record of the mission so far. Right now, he's not really part of it. I put the data about the venom in there, too.” She brought up her own handheld to record the organisms growth for her medical report. “God, I hope we can find a way to keep that from happening to O'Connor.”</span></p><p class="P42">“<span class="T46">You think it might try to take him over like this thing?” Graham looked up from his screen to look Gannon in the eye. “Me too. I just didn't want to be the first to say it.”</span></p><p class="P42"><span class="T46">Gannon replied, </span>“<span class="T46">You know what kills fungal infections of the blood?”</span></p><p class="P45">Graham said, “Amoxicillin, Tetracycline? Lotrimin?”</p><p class="P46">She turned to head out of the lab. “I'll have to look into it.”</p><p class="P46">Graham closed the incubator, to keep the colony from spreading. Then he turned and followed Gannon out. O'Connor was still in bad shape, <span class="T108">but</span> <span class="T108">he was</span> breathing a little better and his heart rate was up.</p><p class="P46">The rest of the squad <span class="T108">stood</span> around O'Connor. Each staring gravely at the fallen man, <span class="T108">looking</span> up at each other every so often. </p><p class="P43">“<span class="T108">I'm here. Let me look at him,” Gannon said. She nudged Cooper and Donovan aside to kneel down by O'Connor. She checked him for responses then set about examining the wounds. She immediately set to work cleaning them.</span></p><p class="P47"><span class="T108">The rest of the team watched in silence. </span>The fungus seemed to shrink a little <span class="T47">as</span> the peroxide bubbled furiously. <span class="T47">Gannon flushed them wounds with water then worked with some small tools to see the extent of the damage. After a few minutes she set down the tools and looked at Cooper.</span></p><p class="P47">“The fungus <span class="T47">i</span>s spreading. <span class="T47">T</span>he edges of the three wounds <span class="T47">a</span>re disintegrating <span class="T47">into fibrous tissues that the fungus is using in its own structure</span>.” <span class="T109">She lifted up a bruised flap of skin at the edge of the wound. The tissue was decaying into a gray gel.</span> “<span class="T47">His</span> <span class="T109">muscles and connective tissues</span> <span class="T47">are</span> slowly being changed. <span class="T109">I don't know if his organs will be next, but I'm betting he doesn't have much time.” She looked at O'Connor's face, now sunken and pale.</span></p><p class="P47">“<span class="T47">Quarantine him,” Cooper said. Graham walked up to stand beside him.</span></p><p class="P47">“<span class="T47">Sergeant Cooper, I looked in on my experiment,” Graham said. Cooper looked at him with a blank expression. “It's growing out of control. There's a bluish mass in the dish where the colony started. The rest of incubator is overgrown with the the black fungus.”</span></p><p class="P47">“<span class="T47">Did you document it?” Cooper looked strained.</span></p><p class="P47">“<span class="T47">Yes, sir. It's on Mitchell's pad.” Graham looked away for a moment, then back to Cooper. His tone was urgent, but quiet. “Sir, I say we forget about the server down below and get the hell out of here. McElheny and O'Connor are down. Let's get them back to the shuttle and back aboard the ship where they can get some real help.”</span></p><p class="P48"><span class="T47">Cooper seemed on the verge of anger, but kept control. </span>“<span class="T47">This isn't a democracy, Technician. If we leave now, someone will have to come back. And, we don't know if what got to McElheny and O'Connor can spread. We can't risk taking it back to the ship until we find out more about it. If we stay, and we get to the server, we might find out if it's worth coming back here at all or if the Gaians should just forget about this place. Also, we have to kill the distress signal. So no one else comes here.” Cooper turned to address the squad.</span></p><p class="P49">“<span class="T48">I know what we've all seen here today is some of the most terrible stuff of our lives. It's beyond imagination, but here it is. In our faces. We don't know what's going to happen to McElheny or O'Connor. Both are alive, O'Connor is unresponsive. There is a swarm of scorpion things below us. Farther below is a computer that has the information we need to call this mission complete. We're down, but far from out. You're all professionals and I know each and every one of us has got the ability. We're warriors. You're here to work your trade. If we stay cold and focus, we'll get this day's work over with. Then we'll get our friends some help, so their wounds won't have been for a screwed up job.”</span></p><p class="P49">“<span class="T110">That's right! Let's do this. Quick and painless,” said Grady. He put on his game face and hefted his rifle.</span></p><p class="P136">Cooper was all business as he started to give his orders. “Gannon, I want you to stay here with the wounded. I want Mitchell to stay and back you up. Mitchell, watch our backs. Keep an eye on those sentries and let us know if anything comes through. Graham, Grady, Donovan and myself will proceed through the tunnels and attempt to enter the facility below from the point of the collapsed roof. Hopefully, it will give is the element of surprise.”</p><p class="P50">“<span class="T48">Terrible idea,” Murphy murmured. In the same instant, he heard Graham mutter the same thing under his breath. But the squad was eager to be done with Phobos.</span></p><p class="P137">The four soldiers left the camp and made their way to the tunnels. Cooper followed last, having spent a few moments grabbing two backpacks from among the gear. He gave one to Grady and kept the other. The troops took a moment to adjust their face plates and suits. One after the other. they crawled through the tunnels to the surface.</p><p class="P48"> </p><p class="P166">The Trees</p><p class="P51">Graham made it out first. <span class="T110">He got up and looked around. There was no sign of motion among the fat black trees. He could see maybe thirty meters in any direction before the forest obscured everything.</span> Donovan emerged from the tunnel <span class="T110">next and he bent to give her a hand. They pulled Cooper out next</span>. <span class="T110">Then, </span>Graham turned around to grab Grady's hand. He helped the private out of the hole and gave his chest a pat, sending chalk dust into the air. <span class="T110">Then he started brushing the dust off his own uniform.</span></p><p class="P51">Cooper <span class="T110">started</span> walking toward the cave in, <span class="T110">glancing frequently at his </span>computer<span class="T110">'s disply</span>. The rest of them followed. Graham looked at his handheld, which showed the wall of the room below about <span class="T111">twenty meters in the direction they were heading</span>. The <span class="T111">cave-in</span> lay <span class="T111">a bit</span> further on, in a thick patch of spindly black trees.</p><p class="P52"><span class="T111">They all kept an eye out as they walked. </span>The sun was still in eclipse. The moon was nearly set, <span class="T111">offering nothing against </span>the darkness. Just the barest outer edge of light <span class="T111">still crept</span> out. “<span class="T111">It looks as if heaven's closed it's eyes to us,” he said.</span> Shadows played in the heights of the skeletal canopy. <span class="T49">The sensors in the faceplate read no heat signatures or motion.</span></p><p class="P52">“<span class="T3">Shut up</span><span class="T111">, Graham,” Mitchell whispered sternly through the radio. “Ugh! That gave me the chills. Christ!”</span></p><p class="P53">The team switched the<span class="T111">ir</span> <span class="T111">rifles lights on</span> before stepping into the cluster of trees. Cooper looked at Grady, then took off his backpack and set it on the ground. Grady caught the Sergeant's meaning and did the same. Each man pulled out disk shaped objects as big across as their heads.</p><p class="P53">Cooper held his pad up to one. The display changed to show the device settings.  He set the timer for manual detonation and showed the screen to Grady who did the same with his. Grady and Cooper removed a second device each. Graham <span class="T111">stole a look</span> in Grady's still lumpy backpack and saw five napalm devices as well as two plasma and two concussion grenades.</p><p class="P53">With the disks set, they were placed back in their bags. <span class="T50">Cooper and Grady took the lead. Donovan and Graham followed to cover them. The team made their way to the sink hole, which was in fact a collapsed ceiling.</span></p><p class="P54">One of the black trees was toppled, exposing its roots to the air. The depression in the earth was less than a meter deep and about a half meter across. In the deepest part of the depression, there was a small passage into the room below. Graham could see the scorpion creatures scurrying around. He could hear <span class="T111">faint </span>echoes <span class="T111">as they kept</span> pounding at the hatch.</p><p class="P54">Cooper took Grady's pack and whispered in his ear. He pointed at Graham and Donovan, gesturing that they should stand back behind Grady. The Sergeant worked a little with his knife, to clear some roots out of the hole. Then he dropped the bags into the hole and started running toward the <span class="T111">other soldiers</span>. <span class="T111">They ran with him.</span> <span class="T111">Cooper and</span> Grady <span class="T111">exchanged a look and</span> hit <span class="T111">the detonators</span>.</p><p class="P55">The earth shook beneath them <span class="T111">as they ran</span>. White dust blew out of the hole, followed by thick smoke. Graham yelled in surprise as a tree to his right burst into flames. Cooper called from in front of him. “Shit! That wasn't supposed to happen.”</p><p class="P56"><span class="T111">A tree</span> <span class="T111">burst into flame on Graham's right as he passed it,</span> <span class="T111">then a trio on his </span><span class="T111">left erupted with fire</span>. </p><p class="P56">“It's getting hotter! I can feel it through my boots,” Donovan <span class="T111">said</span>.</p><p class="P57">“Back to the lab,” Cooper shouted <span class="T111">over the radio</span>. The squad made it out of the trees and ran full speed for the tunnels. <span class="T112">Graham saw</span> <span class="T112">s</span>omething move in the shadows <span class="T112">at the corner of the</span> <span class="T112">station.</span></p><p class="P57">“Sir, I'm reading signs of life. Eight feet by fifteen. <span class="T112">It's coming toward us from the right. Over there</span>,” Graham shouted <span class="T112">as he pointed</span>. </p><p class="P57"><span class="T112">The creature brushed aside the trees as it came</span> into the dim light. <span class="T112">Eight eyes sat at the center of the flat, armored plate of its head</span>. <span class="T112">From it jutted mandibles large enough to crush any of them.</span> <span class="T112">Its</span> two long front legs probed. Static arced where they made contact with the ground <span class="T112">or the trees</span>. <span class="T112">It chattered, as it crawled over the curved wall. When it was in full view, Graham could see a wiggling, squirming mass on its back. Graham pointed his rifle at it.</span></p><p class="P58">As the light from the gun played along the creature's back, Graham saw <span class="T112">that it was multitudes of the creature's young.</span> <span class="T112">Round </span>jellyfish blobs <span class="T112">jostled</span> back and forth <span class="T112">against each other</span> <span class="T112">on gummy legs until</span> <span class="T112">t</span>he creature stopped. <span class="T112">T</span>hey scurried down the side<span class="T112">s</span> of the <span class="T112">giant spider</span> <span class="T112">to the ground where they rushed toward the squad</span>.</p><p class="P58"><span class="T113">While m</span>ost of them <span class="T113">charged</span>, a few went for the <span class="T113">nearby</span> <span class="T113">holes and the labs beyond</span>. “Blow the <span class="T113">tunnels</span>,” Cooper called over the radio. M<span class="T113">itchell</span> responded with a word, garbled by the sound of rifle fire as Donovan, Cooper and Grady began firing plasma shots at the oncoming spider things. A fraction of a second later, the tunnels sprayed dirt and clumps of goo into the air.</p><p class="P58">“Graham! Fire, goddamn it! Kill th<span class="T113">e big one</span>,” Cooper yelled.</p><p class="P58"> Graham raised his rifle and unloaded at the mother scorpion. <span class="T113">Donovan, Mitchell,</span> Cooper and Grady <span class="T113">circled around him,</span> focus<span class="T113">ing</span> their fire on the little creatures <span class="T113">that threatened</span> to swarm <span class="T113">them</span>. <span class="T113">Under Graham's assault, t</span>he carapace on <span class="T113">the spider's</span> belly burst open. <span class="T113">T</span>he creature was still. One of the little ones got past the suppressing fire and skittered up <span class="T113">Graham's</span> leg to his chest.</p><p class="P58">Graham tried to brush it off, but <span class="T113">it</span> deformed as his hand touched it, sliding under the motion of his hand. Graham tried to grab it, but it slipped through his fingers. “<span class="T2">Ah</span>,” he yelled. He swatted frantically at the <span class="T113">gummy</span> <span class="T113">proto-</span>spider, but it crawled over his arm and onto his back. Grady and Donovan rushed over to help him out. “Get this thing off me!” Donovan finally got a hold of the glob behind its legs <span class="T113">as it crawled up to the back of Graham's neck</span>. She threw it to the ground and stomped it until gray gel blew out <span class="T113">around the sides of her boot</span>.</p><p class="P58"><span class="T113">S</span>he <span class="T113">grunted</span>. “<span class="T113">Disgusting little things.”</span></p><p class="P58">“Thank you, <span class="T113">Donovan. I owe you one.”</span> No doubt Graham would have continued, but he was cut off by Cooper.</p><p class="P58">“Graham, I'm seeing motion.”</p><p class="P60">Graham looked at what Cooper was seeing. “The gel <span class="T113">bits are</span> moving again,” <span class="T113">Graham said.</span> </p><p class="P60">Little <span class="T113">dirty</span> globs <span class="T113">rolled</span> together <span class="T113">and started to</span> form bigger globs. In a second, there w<span class="T113">as a handful</span> more critters scurrying through the dirt toward them. Grady and Cooper fired at them, <span class="T113">covering the squad's retreat</span>. </p><p class="P179"><span> Graham's radio crackled. It was Gannon, wondering what was happening. <span class="T51">Right after she was done, Mitchell came on wondering the same thing.</span></span></p><p class="P59">“<span class="T51">We are currently engaged with the enemy,” Cooper yelled over the gunfire. Donovan and Graham were firing right beside Grady. Cooper stepped back to answer Gannon and Mitchell.</span></p><p class="P61">“We<span class="T113">'</span>ll return once we<span class="T113">'</span>ve cleared the premises. Keep it locked tight 'til then. We are proceeding through the forest to discover alternate means of entry to the buried facility if possible. Maintain radio silence.” He took his thumb off the radio.</p><p class="P61">The squad fell back. They fired at the ground whenever they saw movement and after an eternity, the movement in the dirt stopped. For the time being, it seemed the scorpions were gone. Cooper waved them back to the hole where he dropped the charges. </p><p class="P61">Graham looked around at the smoldering trees. <span class="T113">T</span>he thinnest branches <span class="T113">were</span> now ash on the air. He could see <span class="T113">plenty</span> were smoking, <span class="T113">but none were still ablaze</span>. Cooper waved him over to the hole and Graham peered in.</p><p class="P61">The room was full of smoke, but still of sight or sound. The air smelled like charred meat and baked earth. He ran a finger over one of the cut roots in the dirt, its tip <span class="T113">now</span> <span class="T113">cinders</span>. “Temperature reads twenty over expected, but its clear,” Graham said.</p><p class="P61">“Good. Let's try it,” said Cooper. He led the way and all four soldiers dropped into the giant room. A scorpion rushed them from the far corner, but Cooper and Donovan unloaded on it <span class="T113">and it was down in a moment</span>.</p><p class="P61">Graham's boots crunched through <span class="T113">a layer of </span>glaze <span class="T113">on the</span> dirt. He bent to pick up a little sheet<span class="T113">. </span>“Bone china,” he muttered.</p><p class="P61">The team made their way to the single doorway, but it was fused to its frame in the explosion. “<span class="T113">Let's try the other one,” Grady said.</span> It was nearly <span class="T114">blown</span> off its hinges, but some muscles power worked it back enough that the team could proceed single file.</p><p class="P61">Before they went through, Cooper radioed back to the lab. “M<span class="T114">itchell</span>. We've come through the ceiling of the buried facility. <span class="T52">The room is clear.</span> <span class="T52">We will now proceed  with objective. I need you to secure the bulkhead. We need it ready to open when we come back.”</span></p><p class="P61"><span class="T52">Mitchell came back over the radio, </span>“<span class="T52">Copy that, sir.”</span></p><p class="P62">Donovan ducked through the door, followed by Grady, Graham and Cooper. The team stood in a long hallway <span class="T114">with</span> three doors on either side. A single door stood at the far end.</p><p class="P62"><span class="T114">Cooper pressed a couple buttons as he looked at his computer. He looked up and said, </span>“That door.” <span class="T114">He pointed</span> at the one at the end of the hall.</p><p class="P62">The team made their way slowly, clearing each side door as they went. There were no signs of life anywhere. When they reached the last door, Cooper told them to hold up.</p><p class="P62">“<span class="T53">Gannon, Mitchell. We're going further into the facility. Radio silence,” Cooper said over the radio. He waited a moment for the response.</span></p><p class="P63">One never came. Cooper tried again. “M<span class="T114">itchell</span>, respond.”</p><p class="P63">He waited a few seconds, then called for Gannon. After a moment the radio came across with static. A word came through. “...oment. Enemy...(static)...<span class="T54">hr</span>ough. Now secure. O'Conn...(static)...<span class="T114">Mac...</span>up. Await further...uctions.”</p><p class="P63">“You're breaking up, Gannon,” Cooper said. “We<span class="T114">'</span>re going in to the installation. Maintain radio silence and <span class="T54">make sure Mitchell is on the bulkhead.”</span></p><p class="P63">“<span class="T54">(static)...opy that, Sar...”, was Gannon's response.</span></p><p class="P65">Cooper shook his head, then looked back at the squad. He waved them into a crouch. When the soldiers were ready they breached the door. <span class="T115">Graham worked at the controls for a few moments, then gave a thumbs up. Mitchell slid the door open. As soon as it was ready, Donovan and Cooper stepped through, with Graham behind and Grady guarding the rear. </span></p><p class="P65"><span class="T115">Graham crept into </span>dark stairwell. <span class="T115">The platform was of the same heavy duty mesh as the staircase that led to the bulkhead above. The walls here were welded metal panels with three inch straps welded between them. Cooper was already descending the mesh steps to the left. As he turned to follow, Graham</span> looked down the shaft. </p><p class="P65">There w<span class="T115">ere no lights</span> all the way down, but the faceplate made good enough use of the light that Graham could see three flights <span class="T115">further,</span> before the stairs were enveloped in total darkness. <span class="T115">Graham turned and saw the rest of the squad, who were also trying to fathom the depths</span>. Cooper gave a gesture and they <span class="T115">started down</span> <span class="T115">again</span>.</p><p class="P64">In the dark, the view through the faceplate took on a green tint, but it was enough to make out everything in the stairwell. There were no signs of spiders or anything much at all, until Graham spotted a <span class="T116">discolored and deformed</span> patch on the metal grate of the landing they were crossing. <span class="T116">When he bent closer</span>, it was <span class="T116">clear</span> they were looking at the same fungus <span class="T116">growing</span> in <span class="T116">O'Connor's chest</span>. <span class="T116">Graham took out Mitchell's old datapad and added a scan of the decayed metal.</span></p><p class="P66"><span class="T116">As they descended, the patches</span> became <span class="T116">larger and more frequent</span>. After the fifth landing, the stairs were <span class="T116">nearly eaten away</span>. <span class="T116">The team was forced to make their way carefully, sacrificing their stealth and speed.</span></p><p class="P66"><span class="T116">They reached the sixth landing.</span> <span class="T55">The fungus grew in a thick fuzzy mat up the </span><span class="T55">walls and half covered a door. It was the first they came across in the stairwell and the team took it.</span></p><p class="P67">They entered a room with a glass wall on the left. “<span class="T116">It's</span> an observation room,” <span class="T116">Graham said,</span> looking out on the larger room below. It was totally black, except for the lights on the control panels. Graham walked over to one, switching on the <span class="T116">helmet </span>lights. They provided enough glow to read the panel. </p><p class="P67">Cooper came up behind him. “Can you access the server from here?”</p><p class="P67">“I don't know,” <span class="T116">Graham said.</span> “I'm trying. I don't think so, but I think I can find out where it is.”</p><p class="P67">“Hurry up,” Cooper said. He walked back to check the stairwell.</p><p class="P67">After a few moments of looking at the display, Graham went to Cooper. “Sir, <span class="T116">t</span>here's a lab across th<span class="T116">e hangar</span>. <span class="T116">The computer says it's Hayden's personal suite.</span> <span class="T116">It looks like all the </span>labs are on <span class="T116">magnetic</span> lock<span class="T116">down.</span> I'll have to turn on the power to disengage the locks.”</p><p class="P67">“That will tell them we're here,” Cooper replied.</p><p class="P67"><span class="T116">Graham said, </span>“Who's them? The scorpions?”</p><p class="P67">“I don't think it's just scorpions that are the problem,” <span class="T116">Cooper said.</span></p><p class="P67">“We haven't seen any sign of them since we came down,” <span class="T116">Graham responded.</span> “No more have attacked the facility. I think they may have been a fluke. Creatures in their natural habitat.”</p><p class="P67">“Nature? I don't know,” <span class="T116">Cooper said. “M</span>y gut<span class="T116">'</span>s telling me there's something more to this. The spiders and the fungus are related.”</p><p class="P67">“<span class="T56">Whatever is on that server might tell us how,” Graham said. “All I need to do is get in, copy the data and get out. Then we can get the others and go home.”</span></p><p class="P64">“<span class="T56">You're right,” Cooper nodded. “Even if more come, they weren't that hard to kill. We're gonna be on the way home in less than</span> <span class="T56">an hour.”</span></p><p class="P64">“<span class="T56">That's the spirit. Now, if someone stays here and works the controls, I think we can turn on the power right when we get there. Then I'll get to the machine, copy the data or just rip it out of there, whichever's fastest. Then I'll get out, we can turn it off and go home.”</span></p><p class="P64">“<span class="T56">Okay. You, Donovan and I will go. Grady works the controls.” The other two overheard the interaction. They nodded when Cooper looked over at them. Grady stayed in the room, while the others climbed down the crumbling staircase to the bottom floor. They opened the door into cavernous gloom.</span></p><p class="P68">Graham looked up. Far in the distance above them, he could see dim flashes of blue <span class="T117">against the black</span>. It took some looking and the faceplate had to adjust, but in a few moments <span class="T117">the image was clearer.</span> Graham could see a knotted mass of thick black tree roots. They composed the entire ceiling of the chamber and pulses of blue current ran among them as if they were one.</p><p class="P68"><span class="T117">Graham looked away, keeping his eyes on the lab. </span>The three soldiers kept sharp look out for anything. <span class="T117">When they made it to the door.</span> Graham radioed to Grady, “Alright, hit the lights.”</p><p class="P69"><span class="T118">A moment later w</span>hite light filled the room. <span class="T118">Graham could see</span> fungal mass cover<span class="T118">ing</span> most of the walls. Below the <span class="T118">level of the</span> roots <span class="T118">hanging from the ceiling</span> grew fat globs of bluish, gray gel. They ringed the entire chamber, the lowest of them about two meters from the floor, the highest nearly <span class="T57">fifty. Each was larger than a man. On the wall above the lab door, a five-lobed mass seethed in its setting of fungal mat.</span></p><p class="P69">“<span class="T118">I wonder if it knows we're here,” Graham said.</span></p><p class="P69">“<span class="T57">Hurry Graham,” replied Donovan, “Before that thing comes down on us.”</span>  </p><p class="P70">Graham worked at the keypad. “<span class="T119">Ha,” he said. The magnetic locks released and the </span>door slid open. The light came on as he entered. He crossed to the closet and found the server.</p><p class="P71">He hooked up his hand held and attempted to access the files. “<span class="T119">Just like I thought,” Graham said, “It's all here.” </span>In moments he was copying <span class="T119">Doctor Hayden's personal research files</span>. “I'll be done in less than two minutes, Sarge,” he said.</p><p class="P70">Graham heard snapping, popping sounds. He turned around, but saw no sign of Cooper or Donovan near the door. He said, “Hello?” There was no answer.</p><p class="P70">He poked his head out the door, to find Donovan with a large, black something wrapped around her head. Graham grabbed his knife and started hacking at the root. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Cooper suspended by his arms, with a thinner runner covering his mouth. The roots were <span class="T119">lively, squirming around each other and unfolding from the knot above to reach down toward the soldiers</span>.</p><p class="P70">They snapped and popped as they curled around Cooper ever tighter. <span class="T119">They started to pull him off the ground as</span> Graham finished hacking through the one that held Donovan. <span class="T119">It let go</span> as soon as it was severed. She grabbed her rifle and <span class="T119">fired</span> three shots. <span class="T119">They all scored the limb wrapped around</span> Cooper's arm<span class="T119">s</span>. <span class="T119">The creeper let go.</span> <span class="T119">Cooper</span> <span class="T119">pulled</span> his knife <span class="T119">with</span> one hand and <span class="T119">got a hold on</span> a clump of <span class="T119">thin vines</span> with the other. He slashed the knife through the creeper wrapped over his mouth, then wrestled free of the roots <span class="T119">and</span> drop<span class="T119">ped</span> to the ground.</p><p class="P70">He picked up his rifle, standing ready with Donovan. The roots withdrew, but more were descending toward them. Cooper fired a couple potshots into them <span class="T119">as he backed toward the doorway of the lab</span>. The <span class="T119">creepers</span> stayed at a distance, winding around themselves <span class="T119">like clenched fists</span> then relaxing again.</p><p class="P70">“Hurry up, Graham,” Cooper yelled.</p><p class="P70">Graham ran back to the server, to check on his download.</p><p class="P70"><span class="T119">He reported, </span>“Twenty seconds, sir.”</p><p class="P73">Graham jogged back across to where <span class="T119">the others</span> were firing at the arm-thick whips reaching down from the ceiling. <span class="T119">The tendrils formed a wriggling wall wall </span><span class="T119">above them, pressing down as one.</span> <span class="T119">Graham</span> raised his rifle and tagged one of the tendrils twice. It pulled away, <span class="T119">withdrawing into the clump</span>.</p><p class="P72">Two more reached down through the hole the retreating tendril left. They tried to ensnare him, but Cooper and Gannon shot them before they could. Graham picked off one that threatened to wrap around Donovan's head. <span class="T119">She shot one as it grasped</span>  <span class="T119">at</span> Cooper.</p><p class="P72">“Into the lab,” Cooper <span class="T119">barked</span>. Donovan backed into the room, providing Cooper with a barrage of cover fire, which he <span class="T119">took</span> up as <span class="T119">s</span>he backed in <span class="T119">past him</span>. He hit the panel by the door <span class="T119">with his fist</span> <span class="T119">and the door slid closed</span>.</p><p class="P72">“Shit,” Cooper shouted, slamming <span class="T120">the other gloved</span> fist against the door. He picked up his handheld and thumbed the button. “Grady, we're pinned down by those tentacle things.”</p><p class="P72">“Copy, Sergeant Cooper. I saw the whole thing. I have an idea”, Grady said.</p><p class="P72">“Go ahead, Private,” Cooper said.</p><p class="P72">“I think, once you're ready, I can shoot one of these blue masses. Maybe it will get their attention. <span class="T120">D</span>istract the roots from you long enough to make it back here,” Grady explained.</p><p class="P72">Cooper spoke to the room, thumb away from his handheld, “Any other ideas?”</p><p class="P72">Neither Graham or Donovan spoke up, so Cooper told Grady, “Sounds good. I<span class="T120">'</span>ll let you know when we're about to run for it, you concentrate your fire on one of the <span class="T120">globs</span>.”</p><p class="P72">Graham went back to the server and found the transfer was finished. He grabbed his handheld and Mitchell's, set them to synchronize their mission files, then put them in the big pocket on his right leg. “All set,” he told Cooper.</p><p class="P72">“Okay, Grady,” the Sergeant said over the radio. “Let's get this going.”</p><p class="P74">Graham watched <span class="T120">through the lab window</span> as Grady stepped out around the glass  onto a skinny ledge where the wall <span class="T120">was attached to</span> the rock face. <span class="T120">Grady</span> found a double bulbed mass on the right wall, about half way up and closer to him than the others. Grady leveled his rifle and began to fire bursts of plasma rounds into the jelly. Each shot sprayed gouts of charred <span class="T120">and smoking</span> gray-blue bits when <span class="T120">it</span> hit. The surface rippled and spasmed.</p><p class="P74">Cooper yelled, “Now!” <span class="T120">H</span>e hit the button and the door <span class="T120">came</span> open. He was out in the next moment, followed by Donovan, then Graham.</p><p class="P74"> After <span class="T120">Grady's</span> fifth burst the tissue began to smolder. Roots from the ceiling came down in a wriggling knot between <span class="T120">the private</span> and the mass, but the <span class="T120">plasma</span> rounds cut through them. More <span class="T120">descended toward him</span>.</p><p class="P74">Cooper slowed down, raising his rifle to help Grady take some of the creepers <span class="T120">out</span>. Donovan waved Graham forward and they ran faster toward the safety of the stairwell while Cooper slowed. He fired three times at the roots, before charging forward again.</p><p class="P74">More black tendrils descended toward Grady. <span class="T121">From Graham's angle it looked like the private was distracted by the ones in front of him. He was oblivious to the tangle descending just behind him.</span> Cooper yelled over the radio, “Grady, cease fire and retreat!” Grady stopped shooting and stepped backward.</p><p class="P74">Donovan reached the door to the stairs first, Graham was right behind her. He looked <span class="T121">back</span> at Cooper, who shouted, “No!” </p><p class="P74">Graham turned to his right, to see what Cooper was seeing. Grady <span class="T121">tried to</span> <span class="T121">dodge</span> the black tendrils <span class="T121">and misstepped</span>. A<span class="T121">s he fell, a</span> dozen of them wrapped <span class="T121">around him</span> and dragged him up to the ceiling. Graham stepped out of cover and raised his rifle. Cooper began firing at the mass. Graham and Donovan joined, but Grady was gone. More came down, reaching for Cooper now.</p><p class="P74">Donovan yelled, “Get over here, Cooper!” She fired at the grasping roots and Graham joined in. The Sergeant ran toward them, pas<span class="T121">sed</span> them and <span class="T121">ducked</span> into the stairwell. Donovan and Graham <span class="T121">were</span> right behind.</p><p class="P74">They went up the stairs and Graham killed the power in the control room. The team made their way all the way up with no further trouble. They were all silent until they reached the long hallway at the top, when Cooper told M<span class="T121">itchell</span> to open the blast door.</p><p class="P74">Cooper, <span class="T121">Donovan and Graham</span> arrived back at camp <span class="T121">looking</span> defeated. Gannon said, “Where's Grady?”</p><p class="P74">Cooper said, “M.I.A. The roots in the ceiling came alive and tried to take us. Grady covered us and they got him instead.” </p><p class="P74"><span class="T58">Gannon frowned, </span>“<span class="T58">Roots in the ceiling came alive?”</span></p><p class="P75">Cooper nodded. “<span class="T121">They c</span>ame down like octopus tentacles. <span class="T121">W</span>rapped up <span class="T121">me and</span> Donovan in an instant. We got clear and managed to stay free of them. Grady <span class="T121">wanted to crate a diversion</span> <span class="T121">so</span> we <span class="T121">could</span> g<span class="T121">e</span>t back to the stairwell. <span class="T121">He</span> was standing on this skinny ledge, in front of <span class="T121">a</span> big window that overlooks the floor. <span class="T121">He slipped</span> <span class="T121">and th</span>e roots stretched down. <span class="T121">They</span> grabbed him, quick as lightning, wrapped around him <span class="T121">up</span> and pulled him <span class="T121">in where</span> <span class="T121">w</span>e lost sight of him.”</p><p class="P75">“Jesus,” Gannon said, “We need to leave.”</p><p class="P75">“I couldn't agree more. Let's pack up and get to the ship. Gannon, Graham and I will  make stretchers for M<span class="T122">cElheny</span> and O'Connor. I want M<span class="T122">itchell</span> and Donovan on guard duty. Sweep the halls <span class="T122">near</span> our escape route, check on the stairs to the blast door. <span class="T122">I want e</span>veryone ready to scram in fifteen <span class="T122">minutes</span>.”</p><p class="P75">The squad began a flurry of activity as everyone set about their assigned tasks. Donovan and M<span class="T122">itchell</span> double-timed it down the hallway. Cooper followed Gannon to check on <span class="T122">McElheny</span>, while Graham got t<span class="T59">he stretchers together.</span></p><p class="P77">Cooper and Gannon returned <span class="T122">to camp</span> just after Graham. <span class="T122">He was</span> tying the gear to rigs he cobbled together. They spent a moment appreciating Graham's devices. </p><p class="P77">Graham said, “I found a couple real stretchers in the medical lab. I stuck 'em on hand trucks. <span class="T122">N</span>ow I'm tying on <span class="T122">the gear that's</span> already packed. We can just strap O'Connor and M<span class="T122">cElheny</span> each to a cart. <span class="T122">I</span>t should <span class="T122">only take one </span>person a piece to roll them to the ship. Might need a hand on rough terrain, but if you give me an hour, I could have better wheels on them.”</p><p class="P76">Cooper said, “No, I like it. Another hour is not an option. Bring one of your rigs along. We'll get O'Connor taken care of, then we'll get M<span class="T122">ack</span>.”</p><p class="P76">Gannon <span class="T122">went</span> with <span class="T122">them</span> to check o<span class="T122">n</span> O'Connor. Graham could hear the man's shallow breathing. His skin was gray and clammy, becoming more translucent. Two blue-gray bulbs were forming <span class="T122">in the wound</span> on his torso. Patches of gray fuzz <span class="T122">were</span> all <span class="T122">over his chest and running down his abdomen and up his neck</span>.</p><p class="P76"><span class="T122">The medic</span> put on a glove and applied a white salve from a metal tin nearby. The bulbs <span class="T122">in the wound</span> pulsed rapidly as the cream went on, <span class="T122">but</span> the red splotches began to lighten almost instantly. Gannon looked up at Cooper, from where she leaned over O'Connor. “I've let him go without attention too long. I want to stick by him more closely until we get to the ship. Hopefully I can get this fungus under control and heading back the other way.”</p><p class="P76">“Alright,” Cooper said. “Are you saying you want to be the one to haul him to the ship?”</p><p class="P76">“Yes,” replied Gannon. “I can handle the trip as long as we're covered.”</p><p class="P76">“Alright,” Cooper said.</p><p class="P76">“I think I should haul M<span class="T122">cElheny</span>, then,” Graham broke in. “That will leave the best sho<span class="T122">oters</span> to cover us if any more monsters appear.”</p><p class="P76">“<span class="T60">Let's get O'Connor stowed,” Cooper said.</span></p><p class="P79">Cooper took hold of O'Connor under the arms and Graham wrapped an arm around each leg. Together, they transferred the big man to the stretcher part of Graham's cart. They strapped him on with cargo webbing and gun straps.</p><p class="P79">Gannon looked it over and when she was satisfied the patient was secure, she tested how the rig handled. She had a look of concentration on her face as she picked up the handles and rolled it. Leaning was enough get it moving. Suddenly, she smiled. “A rickshaw! That's what it reminds me of. I remember seeing an old encyclopedia with a picture of one. I was having the hardest time remembering the name and I finally picked the word out.”</p><p class="P78">Cooper said, “Great. The improv' rickshaw works like a dream. Let's get Mitchell and get out of here. We can meet up with Donovan and McElheny on the way out.”</p><p class="P80">They returned to get the other cart. Gannon set to work on O'Connor while Cooper and Graham went upstairs with it to get Mitchell. When they reached the upper m<span class="T123">e</span>zzanine, Graham said, “Sir. I can feel the walkway shaking under my feet.  It's like the building's humming.” He set the handles of the cart down and <span class="T61">punched some buttons on his hand-held.</span></p><p class="P83">The display changed to a radiant energy reading, the wave function being generated was a fluctuating rhythm of tall high frequency spikes. They would stretch apart, then crunch together as they rose to fill the screen top to bottom and across it's width.</p><p class="P83">“Sergeant Cooper,” Graham continued, “It matches the oscillation of our distress beacons, but it's cranked up so high I can't pull any data from it. It just overloads the sensors in the handheld. It's infrasound, not radio or a photon pulse. Whatever is making this noise, it's gotta be enormous.”</p><p class="P78"><span class="T124">Cooper looked back over his shoulder and snapped, </span>“<span class="T61">All the more reason to get this done. Let's go, Techician.”</span></p><p class="P81">Graham bent down to grab the handles of the rig and jogged along behind Cooper to M<span class="T124">cElheny'</span>s room. The patient was babbling incoherently until Cooper reached under his armpits. His voice was distant as he asked, “Are we going on an adventure?”</p><p class="P83">“You bet, buddy,” Graham said. He reached down to grab M<span class="T124">cElheny</span>'s legs. <span class="T124">The injured soldier</span> counted down. “Three, two, one. <span class="T124">Blastoff,</span>” <span class="T124">McElheny said.</span></p><p class="P83">Graham chuckled <span class="T124">as he and Cooper lifted McElheny</span>. Cooper tried to fight it, so the smile that broke through was small and lopsided. They pulled up on one and heaved M<span class="T124">cElheny</span> o<span class="T124">nto the stretcher</span>. “Ooof,” said the dazed man. “Oh, I think I'm coming back <span class="T124">and I don't want to</span>. My face hurts,” He said. <span class="T124">Cooper and Graham exchanged looks. The smile was gone.</span> Graham began strapping <span class="T124">McElheny</span> to the rig.</p><p class="P82">“I'm glad to hear that,” Cooper said. “We missed you, Technician.” Cooper passed Graham the loosed end of a belt he was holding, which Graham took. He tightened it around a point where three other straps met, then cinched it down with a buckle and a couple nylon ties.</p><p class="P82">“<span class="T62">All set, sir,” Graham said to Cooper.</span></p><p class="P89">Cooper brought out his radio and spoke into it. “Gannon, get prepped to move. Graham and I are coming down. M<span class="T124">itchell,</span> Donovan. <span class="T124">W</span>e're headed your way. <span class="T124">We'll rendezvous in </span>the hallway.”</p><p class="P89">Gannon's acknowledgment came over loud and clear. After that, a burst of static came through, but no clear response from Donovan or Mitchell. Cooper grunted after a few seconds of waiting, but only told Graham it was time to move out.</p><p class="P89">Gannon fell in behind Cooper and Graham, who made a bee line for the door to the <span class="T125">lobby</span>. M<span class="T125">cElheny</span> was speaking in low tones behind Graham, so that most of what he said couldn't be heard. A few yards from the door, he spoke up.</p><p class="P82">“<span class="T62">It's the voice. I thought it was a dream, or a hallucination from the venom. It's not. He's here.” Mitchell's words decayed to incoherency.</span></p><p class="P90">Graham <span class="T125">asked, “Who's here</span>. <span class="T125">Do you mean Hayden?” </span></p><p class="P90">“<span class="T125">Beneath us,” McElheny said. “The voice says it's all around, but I hear it like it's right below me.”</span></p><p class="P90">Cooper opened the doors, then popped his head through. “No sign of Donovan or M<span class="T125">itchell</span>,” he said when he turned back to Gannon and Graham. He raised his radio to his face. “Donovan, do you read me? Over.” He waited a few seconds. “M<span class="T125">itchell</span>, do you copy this? Over.” There was no response.</p><p class="P89">He said, “Graham, Gannon. I'll lead you to the front doors. You'll wait with O'Connor and Mitchell while I find out what happened to the others. Fast as we can down the hall. Now.” Then Cooper opened the doors, holding them wide on the other side. Graham and Gannon dragged their carts through and kept building up speed as they crossed under the mezzanine and out into the hallway. Cooper slammed the doors behind him and ran after them, his gun raised.</p><p class="P180"> <span class="T126">Seething mats of black tendrils grew to</span> cover most of the <span class="T126">left side of</span> mezzanine above <span class="T126">since the last time Graham saw it</span>. <span class="T126">They grew thickest around the entry to the short hallway, a writhing puddle of tar creeping out across to the railing. T</span>hick trunks <span class="T126">curled over the rail and</span> <span class="T126">down the wall</span> like legs. <span class="T126">It was as if </span>the whole mass was making a single, <span class="T126">very</span> slow step. </p><p class="P138">Rifle shots and bursts of light came from the <span class="T126">hallway.</span> The <span class="T126">sentry</span> turrets at the top of the ancient metal stairs <span class="T126">near that side of the mezzanine</span> kicked on. <span class="T126">T</span>hrough the strobing flash Graham saw Donovan shove a limp M<span class="T126">itchell</span> through the doorway with her left hand, then emerge. <span class="T126">She was tracking something with the rifle in her right hand</span>. </p><p class="P138"><span class="T126">As Mitchell staggered forward, she</span> brought the other hand up to steady her shot and fired twice. In seemingly the same motion, she brought a grenade out, set it and tossed it underhand. Then she grabbed M<span class="T126">itchell.</span> <span class="T126">He</span> stiffened into a quick walk for a few steps, as if he were getting reoriented. If a few steps, they were running. </p><p class="P138">They raced the explosion and made it to the staircase near the entrance. Graham watched as they hit the top of the stairs. <span class="T126">Then Mitchell</span> stumble<span class="T126">d</span>.</p><p class="P138">Donovan ran back up three steps and helped him up. Motion caught Graham's eye and he turned to see a mass of the thick black tendrils fill<span class="T126">ing</span> the <span class="T126">hallway</span>. <span class="T126">They pressed around themselves, trying to creep out.</span> The grenade went off, illuminating something solid deep in the mass.</p><p class="P139">Flames licked through the thinner parts of the knotted tendrils, but there seemed to be no effect on the whole mass. Two massive roots, as round as a human torso, smashed through the <span class="T127">frame of the entryway to the hall</span>. <span class="T127">They flopped over the rail to the lobby floor.</span></p><p class="P139">Smoke billowed out and knots of smaller creepers filled the new spaces as chunks of the crumbling wall gave under the pressure of the mass. <span class="T127">More</span> massive trunks flopped themselves over the metal banister. It began to curl over, allowing more of the squirming, knotted mass to spill over down to the <span class="T127">first</span> level.</p><p class="P139">“Grady...”, M<span class="T127">cElheny</span> whispered <span class="T127">from the stretcher behind Graham.</span> Donovan yelled something. Graham barely heard. </p><p class="P139">He asked Cooper, “What did Donovan say?”</p><p class="P139">Cooper said, “I don't know, I couldn't hear.” He was staring up at the doorway as they jogged. “Let's move.”</p><p class="P139">Graham turned to run toward the door, <span class="T127">with McElheny in tow</span>. Cooper ran to Donovan, taking M<span class="T127">itchell's</span> arm off her shoulder. Graham didn't stop to look back until he was at the airlock door.</p><p class="P139">“Grady…,” M<span class="T127">cElheny whispered</span>. “Hayden <span class="T127">says he's taken him</span>. <span class="T127">I could hear the whisper in my mind. Even through the gunfire. </span>”</p><p class="P139">Graham looked back, to see Gannon right behind him. Not far behind Gannon, Donovan covered Cooper and M<span class="T127">itchell</span>'s progress as the injured man limped along. Another wave of <span class="T127">t</span>endrils poured over the edge from the second level. <span class="T127">This time, something was being carried with the creepers</span>.</p><p class="P139">“It's Grady,” Donovan yelled. “The roots took his body over!”</p><p class="P92">“My God,” Graham said, as the mass pushed Grady's corpse through the door. </p><p class="P92">It seemed oddly flat, it was too <span class="T127">much like an empty sack</span> to be a real body. The mass wove itself <span class="T127">all through</span> <span class="T127">Grady</span>. <span class="T127">It</span> stitched itself into his eyes, mouth, nose, and ears. It grew in fibrous <span class="T127">cords</span> <span class="T127">through</span> his fingertips and down his arms. It wound around his thighs and down his legs and ran in stranded cords into his boots.</p><p class="P91">As <span class="T127">the corpse</span> <span class="T127">was conveyed toward them</span>, the mass tucked itself <span class="T127">in</span>. The <span class="T127">body's</span> shape began to fill out. The shape became tighter, the skin took on <span class="T127">dimension, even</span> some color. It moved Grady's arms, the loose fray of the mass twisting and becoming the muscle. Now it approached, even more like Grady was, <span class="T127">floating</span> upright  along the mat of vines.</p><p class="P140">Graham tried the door. It didn't open. He swore and Cooper rushed over. Graham looked back at the mass. </p><p class="P140">Grady stared at them, his eyes were glossy black. When he reached the end of the mass, runners burst out from the bottom of his boots. <span class="T127">I</span>t looked as if he crossed the gap between them <span class="T127">carried on</span> a cloud of black lightning.</p><p class="P84">Cooper couldn't get the door open either. He yelled, “Graham, get us around this thing!”</p><p class="P84">“Sir,” Graham replied. He switched Cooper spots, then raised his handheld and began to work on the lock. From over his shoulder, he heard Cooper say, “Donovan, let's go. <span class="T127">We're gonna</span> <span class="T127">h</span>old him off <span class="T127">while Graham opens the door</span>. Plasma with a phosphorous finale.”</p><p class="P84">“Got it,” Donovan said, then switched her gun and grenades. “P&amp;P, ready.”</p><p class="P85">They moved away and in a few moments, Graham heard gunshots. <span class="T63">He fiddled with the controls as Cooper shouted orders. Gannon came to check on McElehney as Graham worked. He had the control panel bypassed within twenty seconds. The doors slid open and Graham stood up. </span></p><p class="P87">He turned around to see <span class="T127">how Cooper and Donovan were doing.</span> Donovan <span class="T127">was</span> held up by thick vines <span class="T127">circling</span> her abdomen. The<span class="T127">y</span> flexed and constricted, attempting to snap her spine. M<span class="T127">itchell</span> lifted his rifle and took careful aim. Then he limped forward a few steps and started to fire at the creepers. Cooper focused on the other side.</p><p class="P87">Graham said, ”Let's go, Gannon. Get ready to start shooting if we need to. Plasma and phosphorous.”</p><p class="P86">Gannon nodded and they took their rickshaws into the airlock. They made sure that the injured men were tucked away just inside the doors. Then, Graham stepped out, rifle raised.</p><p class="P86">Grady let go of Donovan. Now he was trying to hit her with whips <span class="T127">from his fingers</span> while shielding himself from M<span class="T127">itchell</span>'s attack. This left <span class="T127">Grady</span> open for Donovan's shots, or Cooper's, whichever he was not defending from. Cooper yelled for them to hit the grenades. Each <span class="T127">tossed one at Grady</span>, then ran for the door.</p><p class="P86">They were only a few feet from the door when the grenades went off. Flashes of white fire made their shapes black <span class="T128">in Graham's vision</span> as the <span class="T128">soldiers</span> <span class="T128">ran in</span>to the airlock. <span class="T128">They all turned and concentrated their fire.</span></p><p class="P86">“<span class="T128">Grenades</span>,” Cooper yelled. This time all five soldiers rolled a grenade out the door. Graham hit the panel and the thick airlock door slid shut. He crossed the garage-sized room to open the outside door. As it began to slide open the grenades went off behind the <span class="T64">other</span> door.</p><p class="P88">In five seconds, the doors were open and the soldiers were outside. The doors slid closed once more and they breathed a collective sigh of relief. “<span class="T128">There was j</span>ust the one folks. <span class="T128">L</span>et's keep it going,” Cooper said. He helped the more collected M<span class="T128">itchell</span> along. <span class="T128">Gannon, Graham and</span> the carts followed behind. Donovan guarded the rear.</p><p class="P88"> </p><p class="P167">The Sound</p><p class="P143"><span class="T41">The squad headed out through the black trees, the carts rolling easily on the white alkali hard pan. </span><span class="T43">The sky was dimming, the sun was a silver bowl holding the dark shadow of the moon just over the horizon. Graham said, “Another eclipse...figures.”</span></p><p class="P143"><span class="T41">It wasn't long before Graham heard a noise behind them and turned. </span><span class="T43">The airlock door was sliding open. He shouted a warning to Cooper.</span></p><p class="P93">Cooper shouted, “Copy that, Graham! Double time, team!”</p><p class="P94">Graham looked back over his shoulder again. Grady was standing out in front of the facility. He sent his creepers running across the surface and into the dirt after them. When the creepers reached the trees, they began to shake. It was like a wave coming toward them.</p><p class="P94">As it passed around them, the limbs of the trees rattled together like dry bones. The silver sunlight cast a miasma of shadows all over, that sliced and twisted everything Graham saw. Graham pressed on, looking down at his handheld to see how far the ship was. One kilometer to the northwest. Only <span class="T128">a hundred and </span>sixty more meters of trees, then they w<span class="T128">ould be</span> free of the forest.</p><p class="P94">Graham was starting to breath hard. <span class="T128">H</span>e could hear the rest of the squad <span class="T65">over the helmet radio, they were all doing the same. The going was slow as Gannon and Graham maneuvered the carts around the trees. Donovan, Mitchell and Cooper were covering the others, scanning the trees all around. The trees continued to shake, now so violently that the ground resonated under their boots.</span></p><p class="P95">One of the larger trees far in the distance to the left toppled in a huge cloud of dust. Something large and round rose up to replace it. Graham looked toward it and said, “Sir, something came up from the ground. It's obscured by the dust. My eleven o'clock.”</p><p class="P95">“Copy, Graham,” came Cooper's response. “We've got a few more problems at our six.”</p><p class="P95">Graham kept his eye on the thing in the distance. It dipped out of sight for a moment, but Graham thought he could see something moving. <span class="T128">It was</span> long and low, <span class="T128">going quickly</span> through the <span class="T128">dust</span>. Graham asked, “What kind of problems, sir?”</p><p class="P95">There was no response other than rifle shots. First one began firing a short burst, then two others joined in. Graham picked up his rifle and turned around. He was face to face with Cooper. The Sargent was red faced as he yelled, “Don't stop running! Get to the ship!”</p><p class="P95">Donovan and M<span class="T128">itchell</span> were firing at three of the scorpion creatures, <span class="T66">each</span> the size of <span class="T66">a small cargo van. The crust of ground was caved in ten feet behind the creatures. Farther off and to the right, Grady rode the mass of creepers slowly toward them.</span></p><p class="P96">Graham dropped the rifle, which dangled from <span class="T128">the</span> strap <span class="T128">around his chest</span>. He picked up the handles of the cart and started to run again. He looked to check on Gannon, who was running toward the fallen tree. <span class="T128">Graham saw</span> motion <span class="T128">near the ground ahead of her</span>.</p><p class="P96">“Gannon,” Graham yelled over the radio, “Turn right! There's a large hole ahead <span class="T128">and</span> I think <span class="T128">something</span> crawled out! <span class="T128">Veer</span> right.</p><p class="P96">She turned and dodged the hole. The cart behind her bounced and nearly toppled, but she leaned over the opposite way and kept pulling. It jarred down and O'Connor began to squirm. “Looks like O'Connor is moving around,” Graham said over the radio.</p><p class="P96">Gannon said, “Yes. He's not in his right mind. I have more trouble than that. There's definitely something moving around out here. I'm pretty sure it knows I'm here. Requesting assistance! Ah!”</p><p class="P97">The shadows in a cluster of black trees broke into pieces and skittered around Gannon, trying to harry her. It was getting darker very fast now <span class="T128">and from where Graham was watching there wasn't much he could see.</span></p><p class="P98">Cooper said, “We've neutralized our targets. Heading to you, Gannon. Graham, keep on toward the ship.”</p><p class="P98">The three gunners came around Graham's left side and ran toward Gannon. She was defending herself as well as she could, but there were too many of the creatures. She started spraying them randomly with rifle bursts.</p><p class="P98">“Gannon! Keep it level,” Cooper said. “Back away from them, we're just a couple seconds away from you.” </p><p class="P98">O'Connor was thrashing around. <span class="T128">I</span>t didn't look like the straps were holding <span class="T128">him</span>. As Graham ran by, he saw Gannon trip as she backed over a root. She managed to take three of the six that were hounding her, but <span class="T128">she</span> was distracted by O'Connor and tumbled into the dirt and lumpy roots. O'Connor free<span class="T128">d</span> himself. <span class="T128">As he stood up</span> a mat of fuzzy tissue sloughed off his chest and fell to the ground <span class="T128">at his feet</span>. This staggered him, but he reached down and grabbed <span class="T129">one of the creatures</span> by the tail. He raised it like a battle ax and swiped across the other two scorpions, saving Gannon.</p><p class="P98">As the swing came to an end, plasma shots sprayed him in the chest. One hit the scorpion <span class="T129">he was holding</span> and its body exploded. <span class="T129">Gannon and Mitchell gasped.</span> O'Connor fell, his chest smoldering, his hands still clutching the monster's tail. Cooper and company ran up. <span class="T129">They</span> finished the other two scorpions. Then, Graham could see no more. He turned his attention to the way ahead.</p><p class="P98">Full dark was nearly upon them. The last rays of twilight were creeping over the horizon. The moon still eclipsed the sun, which nearly managed to creep out from the moon's shadow before nightfall, but not quite. Graham looked around at the quivering treetops.</p><p class="P98">He said, “I think I'm seeing something moving in the trees, sarge.”</p><p class="P98"><span class="T67">Cooper responded, </span>“<span class="T67">We're not too far behind you Graham, slow it down a bit if you want us to lead.”</span></p><p class="P99">He did, but rifle fire erupted from behind him. “Get to the ship,” Cooper yelled, “It's Grady, shit. He's <span class="T129">caught up with us and has</span> more of the scorpions with him. <span class="T69">Gannon! Graham!</span> <span class="T69">G</span>et out of here!”</p><p class="P101">Graham ran and the sun sank lower. Grenades and rifle shots exploded behind him. Big things moved above him, but Graham ran on. </p><p class="P101">He reached a run of flat ground and risked a quick tap on the handheld strapped to his left forearm. It displayed the vital signs of the rest of the team. M<span class="T129">itchell</span> was tachycardic. Donovan and Cooper were alright, but maximally stressed. Gannon and Graham looked little better. M<span class="T129">cElheny</span> was looking alright, even and stable.</p><p class="P101">Graham said, “Mitchell, you hanging in there?” There was no response.</p><p class="P101"><span class="T129">T</span>he dim light still reve<span class="T129">a</span>led the outline of the ship, <span class="T129">way out across the empty plain</span>. The patch of trees would thin out in a few <span class="T129">meters</span>. <span class="T129">Then</span> there were a few <span class="T129">meters</span> of bare ground, then the welcoming lights of the ship.</p><p class="P99">A few feet <span class="T129">a</span>way, <span class="T129">on his left,</span> there was movement among the roots. On his right, Graham saw a blue glow, which quickly disappeared. A few seconds later, there was another on his left, about halfway up a tree trunk. </p><p class="P99">This one he saw more clearly than the last. It was a round blob of jelly, similar to the ones that grew from O'Connor's wound and from the walls of the hangar far below. Unlike the others, this one scurried around the tree on four pudgy legs.</p><p class="P108">Another crawled over the roots toward him. The pulsing bulb of its body jiggled as it rolled up to stand on the foremost two legs. The surface of its bulbous part split, revealing two large, black eyes and a grin of razor teeth that spread across the whole thing. It hissed and raised the back two legs. It held them up like the arms of a boxer, just before the first punch.</p><p class="P108">Graham laughed at the preposterous thing, which seemed more cute than threatening. He kicked out as he walked by, sending a chunk of goo <span class="T129">with one of the black eyes</span> sailing into the thicket. The rest of the creature fell over. Vital fluids ran from the hole.</p><p class="P100">In moments, more appeared. <span class="T129">Adrenaline kicked in and Graham ran.</span> <span class="T68">The protospiders scuttled down the trees. They scuttled across the roots toward him as Graham ran by. Full dark fell and they began to glow. Graham looked around. Everywhere, little blue lights were running toward him. They flooded the ground between him and the rest of the squad.</span></p><p class="P108"><span class="T129">When </span>Graham was close enough the ship's proximity sensors triggered the bay doors. The ramp opened slowly, the white light from within gradually <span class="T129">flooded</span> the darkness. Graham looked left and behind him. There was Gannon, breathing hard, <span class="T129">hauling the rig of gear</span>. Graham slowed and she seemed to understand why.</p><p class="P102">Gannon ran past him and <span class="T129">dropped the rickshaw. She fell in beside Graham</span> in a shooting stance, <span class="T129">then</span> opened up on the protospiders. <span class="T129">A</span> <span class="T129">s</span>wath <span class="T129">opened up</span> with <span class="T129">her</span> rapid plasma shots. Graham <span class="T129">fired right along with her</span>.</p><p class="P103">The spiders came faster, piling up on each other. Gannon took out a grenade and cried, “Napalm!”</p><p class="P103">Graham stopped <span class="T129">firing</span>. She tossed it and a second later flaming fuel blew out in a six foot radius across the spiders. More caught fire as they crawled across the already flaming heaps, <span class="T129">but the fire</span> seemed to stall them.</p><p class="P102">Graham said, “<span class="T129">You</span> lovely woman!. Now's our time!” Tired as he was he sprinted toward the ship, trailing the cart behind him.</p><p class="P103">He closed the distance to the ship before the ramp was all the way down. The <span class="T129">door was open enough that the </span>small turrets just inside the entryway started tracking the baby scorpions. Short bursts cracked out whenever one came too close. </p><p class="P103">Graham had time to put down the cart and raise his rifle before Gannon arrived. <span class="T129">When she did, t</span>hey fired at the approaching monsters. <span class="T129">T</span>ogether with the ships automated defenses, <span class="T129">they</span> held the <span class="T129">spiders</span> at bay until Cooper and Donovan <span class="T129">could </span><span class="T129">get there</span>.</p><p class="P103">Graham glanced down at his handheld. Cooper was down now, but not dead. </p><p class="P103">“Gannon,” Graham said, “Cooper and M<span class="T129">itchell</span> are down. <span class="T70">Donovan's still fighting, but she'll stay with them until she goes down, too. Grady was there. I think we should go get them with the ship.”</span></p><p class="P105">Gannon nodded, but kept firing as she moved toward M<span class="T129">cElheny</span>. “Cover me,” she said. Then she dropped her rifle, letting it hang. <span class="T130">S</span>he pick<span class="T130">ed</span> up the handles of the cart <span class="T130">to</span> drag it into the ship as Graham covered her.</p><p class="P105">The creatures were coming faster than the turrets and Graham's rifle could keep up with. He backed into the ship and hit the controls. The ramp began to raise. Graham fired the rifle until the hole was <span class="T130">just</span> small enough, then dropped a pair of grenades. As the door closed, Graham could hear the explosions. He ran to the pilot deck and told Gannon, “Strap in, we're up and out.” He punched some buttons. <span class="T130">Out the window,</span> the ground fell away as the ship rose into the dark.</p><p class="P104">The ship skimmed over the treetops to the rest of the crew's position. Donovan and Cooper were still shooting as they moved toward the ship. Five scorpions the size of heavy tanks stomped toward them. Each <span class="T130">of the giants</span> was covered in a pile of glowing blue young. <span class="T130">Graham could see that the blue</span> swarm was retreating from where the ship took off and headed <span class="T71">toward the survivors.</span></p><p class="P106">“I have to do something,” Graham said.</p><p class="P106">He ran back to the controls and armed the weapons. <span class="T72">Graham turned on the turrets   mounted under the front of the craft. They fired at the smaller critters automatically. With the small guns set, Graham switched the fire controls to the main plasma cannons. </span></p><p class="P107">He hit a couple of the largest scorpions, but the young crawled away from the smoldering bodies of the larger ones. The display showed video feed of the jelly-like things coming together in masses among the flood. The<span class="T130">y</span> piled on top of each other, balling up like fists. Five of them drew up yards apart and began to roll over the swarm <span class="T74">on</span> ground. </p><p class="P107">Graham couldn't target them, he would have to fly lower or reverse to get a decent angle. He thumbed his radio and said, “Donovan, I can't get a good shot at the masses coming your way. I'm going to lower the ramp and we'll drop a <span class="T73">cargo net</span>. <span class="T73">Gannon, send down the net.”</span></p><p class="P109">Graham heard the steps as Gannon ran to the control panel. The boom started to extend. “The net's bunched up”, she said a few moments later. Meanwhile, Graham flipped through the screens of the ships computer. “Oh, wait. There it goes,” Gannon said over the radio, “I'm starting to lower it.”</p><p class="P111">The screen filled with a camera's view of the cargo net lowering. Graham <span class="T130">cried</span>, “Hurry up! Stupid machine!”</p><p class="P111">Donovan <span class="T130">hunched over</span>, struggling to drag Cooper within distance. He covered her, though his legs were a mess, and kept the spiders off them until Donovan dragged him over. Shots came from somewhere off camera. They tagged a few that Cooper wasn't able to get, suggesting that M<span class="T130">itchell</span> was still capable of firing his rifle.</p><p class="P109">Donovan started firing an instant after she stopped dragging Cooper. Her voice came over the com line, “I gotta go back for M<span class="T131">itchell</span>!”</p><p class="P109">She ran quickly off camera. “Don't do it, Donovan. Just get <span class="T131">on</span> the ship,” Graham yelled.</p><p class="P109">“I have a plan,” Donovan rep<span class="T76">l</span>ied.</p><p class="P110">The control panel showed that the net was all the way down. Graham watched Cooper <span class="T75">crawl into the cargo net, still firing. Most of the rounds missed, but he got a few more spiders. As he got himself settled, Donovan came back on screen, dragging Mitchell. He fired away as Donovan hauled him along under cover fire from Cooper and the automatic turrets.</span></p><p class="P132">“Bring up the net,” Cooper shouted. Donovan rolled <span class="T131">Mitchell</span> onto the net. <span class="T131">Then she began to fire with one hand as she grabbed hold of the net with the other.</span> Cooper braced himself as the tension on the net started to shift everything to the center, threatening to mas<span class="T131">h</span> the soldiers against <span class="T131">each other</span>.</p><p class="P132">All three fired as the wave of blue spiders reached them. Two of the <span class="T131">rolling</span> masses <span class="T131">of protospiders</span> swelled up high, trying to reach the ascending soldiers. With a grimace of pain, Cooper reached for his grenades. He armed them, then dropped them.</p><p class="P132">Graham <span class="T131">tapped</span> the thrusters, propelling the ship straight upward. Two blossoms of fire erupted below the net. M<span class="T131">itchell</span> and Donovan began dropping the last of their grenades as well.</p><p class="P132">The net rose, the ship rose and fire erupted in smaller bursts as they put more distance between themselves and the ground. However, the trees stayed with them. “The trees are following us,” Cooper yelled. M<span class="T131">itchell</span> and Donovan started firing at the branches, but they started grasping at the net and soon worked their way trough the mesh.</p><p class="P132"> Donovan and Cooper pulled out their knives to cut the tendrils, trying to free the net. The engines whined under the strain and the winch attached to the net started to heat up, according to the readout.</p><p class="P110">“<span class="T75">Gannon,” Graham called back to the cargo bay, “what are you seeing back there?”</span></p><p class="P112">The smoke cleared and the field below was visible through the camera once more. There was Grady, held up by the mass of alien vegetation. His arms were raised, as if he commanded the reaching trees. “I have a visual on Grady,” <span class="T131">Graham exclaimed.</span></p><p class="P112">Cooper's voice came across, panting. “Can you target him? Blast him with everything we've got. We aren't going anywhere with the net wrapped up like it is.  Give the engines a rest Graham.”</p><p class="P112">Gannon said, “I'm worried about the winch. The machinery is humming pretty bad back here. Also, the gear on M<span class="T131">cElheny</span>'s cart looks to be contaminated. I'm seeing a lot of gray fuzz spreading <span class="T131">overeverything</span>.”</p><p class="P112">“Great! We never should have come to this rock,” Graham shouted over the radio. The stress made his voice come out high and nasal.</p><p class="P112">He set the controls to auto and went back to the cargo bay. There, he found Gannon, running back and forth from the overheating winch to the medical bay. Graham looked in the observation window to see M<span class="T131">cElheny</span> babbling soundlessly and thrashing against his restraints.</p><p class="P112">“Take care of M<span class="T131">ack</span>! I'll deal with the net,” Graham said.</p><p class="P112">He walked to the crates of gear, and began tossing them aside until he found one labeled “C.R.” He opened the case and found a winch. Graham put it on the floor, then went to a sentry turret case. He pulled out the <span class="T131">sturdy</span> tripod. Graham went back to the C.R. crate and pulled out a rivet gun.</p><p class="P112">With three quick blasts from the gun, he bolted the legs of the tripod to the deck. After the tripod was secure, he attached the winch <span class="T131">to it</span> with a couple more rivets. Graham grabbed the locking hook attached to the winch cable and slapped it  around the cable running through the boom. When he flipped his improvised rig on, the other winch began to wind more easily. <span class="T131">T</span>he <span class="T131">net's</span> cable slip<span class="T131">ped</span> slowly through the hook of the other as <span class="T131">the other winch </span>pulled <span class="T76">on the cable from the side.</span></p><p class="P113">Gannon screamed and Graham looked up. M<span class="T131">cElheny</span> had her by the throat, a syringe dangled limply from his neck. Graham grabbed a rifle from the rack on the wall and ran to help her. He glanced at the cart which was swiftly being covered by a mat of gray mycelium.</p><p class="P113">When Graham rounded the corner into the medical bay, McElheny was <span class="T132">talking</span>, “...Wants us! Wants <span class="T132">bring us along</span>. <span class="T132">Upward.</span> Must keep the pieces together. He wants it all, wants us back! He's calling me to join him <span class="T132">and</span> my bones want it! My body is already his and he <span class="T132">is clawing</span> at my mind. I don't want to resist anymore. Oh, it hurts!”</p><p class="P114">Gannon choked out his name, “..cElheny… Let… me… heck... help! Trying… to… <span class="T132">to</span> save you!” Her face was turning red and looking swollen by the blood pressure. Graham <span class="T132">saw</span> the syringe in McElheny's neck. He moved for it and got his fingers around it before McElheny <span class="T132">noticed</span>.</p><p class="P114"><span class="T132">McElheny</span> dropped Gannon, who gasped and swallowed the air, her face quickly returning to <span class="T132">normal</span> color. Graham squeezed the plunger before McElheny flung him away. He slammed into a cabinet, <span class="T132">rattling</span> <span class="T132">its contents</span>.</p><p class="P113"> “Graham!” It was Cooper on the radio. McElheny picked Graham up <span class="T132">by his shoulders,</span> <span class="T132">then</span> <span class="T77">shook him like a wet winter coat. Cooper continued, “Graham, we're free! On our way up, nice work.”</span></p><p class="P115">Graham wriggled around and got his rifle between him and McElheny. Using it like a crowbar, he tried to lever the butt of the gun so that the barrel pointed straight into McElheny's chest, but the man was too strong. Gannon struggle<span class="T132">d</span> to her feet <span class="T132">in the corner of his vision</span> as he tried to wrestle McElheny away.</p><p class="P115">She went to a drawer nearby and started opening packages. Graham shoved <span class="T132">hard</span> and finally got McElheny's hand off him. It was enough of a chance for him to level the gun at McElheny and take a shot.</p><p class="P116">Gannon came up behind McElheny and raised her fists. Each one clutched a handful of syringes. She slammed them into the man's meaty shoulders, near the neck and slapped at them to depress the plungers.</p><p class="P116">McElheny spun around on her and roared an inhuman sound. He swung his arm across his body and slapped her <span class="T132">head</span> backhand. She went down in a heap. Her attacker stepped toward her, but Graham turned his rifle on McElheny and fired three shots.</p><p class="P115">Chunks of the man's abdomen fell away. They lay smoldering on the deck, amalgamate mats of human tissue and alien fungus. When McElheny turned toward him,  Graham could see the bulbs of blue-gray pulsing in the man's body cavity in place of the organs that once were there. They swelled to fill the empty space as McElheny shambled toward him.</p><p class="P115">Graham backed out of the medical bay to the cargo <span class="T133">hold</span>. The top of the net <span class="T78">was clearing the bay door, but the second winch was now causing the cable running through the boom arm to bind up. Donovan was reaching up through the top of the net, trying to detach the second hook.</span> <span class="T78">Graham ran over and turned it off.</span></p><p class="P117">“<span class="T133">Behind you,” Donovan shouted. The net was still a few feet out. The boom was retracting. There was nothing the squad could do but wait the eternal moments it took to get them into the cargo hold.</span></p><p class="P117"><span class="T133">McElheny picked Graham up in a bear hug, then walked </span>toward the heap of fungus covered gear that once was <span class="T133">his stretcher</span>. McElheny tossed a couple of crates aside and wrecked the cart to get to the server from the ancient base.</p><p class="P183">With the server under one arm and Graham clamped under the other, McElheny stomped to the bay door. The survivors from the surface were finally in the cargo bay. Donovan worked to get the net open as Cooper fired a couple of rifle rounds into the approaching McElheny. The man never slowed.</p><p class="P171"><span class="T28">Donovan made it out of the net and to the controls. </span><span class="T29">She</span><span class="T28"> hit </span><span class="T29">the</span><span class="T28"> button </span><span class="T29">to close the ramp</span><span class="T28">. </span><span class="T29">Gannon</span><span class="T28"> dove for her rifle, </span><span class="T29">then</span><span class="T28"> </span><span class="T29">fired</span><span class="T28"> at McElheny's back. He dropped Graham to the ground, shoved the server </span><span class="T29">into</span><span class="T28"> </span><span class="T29">Graham's arms, then </span><span class="T28">kicked Graham over the edge.</span></p><p class="P117">Graham screamed as he watched the ship fall away. In a few seconds, he crashed into the fat limbs of a waiting tree. The wind was knocked out of him. <span class="T133">T</span>he grasping branches wrapped around him. The treetops all around began to withdraw. Graham watched as <span class="T79">shots flew out of the cargo bay until the door was closed. A moment later, without a word over the radio, the ship began to turn. The main engines kicked on. In moments, the ship was headed out of the atmosphere with a bubble of glowing gases spread across the hull.</span></p><p class="P118"/><p class="P168">The One You Serve</p><p class="P118">The branches wrapped tighter, holding the server tighter to <span class="T134">Graham</span> as they drew him down to the surface. The fuzzy server began to squirm against his chest. “Great! They left without me!” Graham shouted over his radio, ”You bastards! You goddamn bastards!” The radio was dead.</p><p class="P118">Eventually, when Graham was just five feet over the alkali dust, the tension <span class="T134">in his bonds </span>subsided. <span class="T134">T</span>he server was lifted away. The limbs set him down, standing on the surface of Phobos. Graham turned around, rapidly looking every direction. He saw Grady in the distance, but the scorpion creatures were gone. Creepers preceded Grady's approach, scrabbling through the dust to draw him along.</p><p class="P120">Grady was smiling as he made his slow approach. A human shape came from around a near tree, yards closer than Grady. It came closer and Graham could see it was what was left of O'Connor, <span class="T134">animated</span> by the creepers just like Grady was.</p><p class="P119"><span class="T80">Graham ran. He took off in the most opposite direction to both men that he could find. He made it past a few trees, but the ground began to shake. Everything vibrated with a sound</span> <span class="T80">like laughter, as if Phobos itself were laughing.</span></p><p class="P120">Graham ran too near a looming tree. <span class="T134">It</span> leaned a large branch over as Graham turned his head to look behind him. His head stopped, but his feet kept going. <span class="T134">S</span>uddenly, he was on the ground. Chunks of earth around him fell away. Leaving black holes. Soon, blue globs scuttled out of them on their jelly legs to cover him. <span class="T134">Then</span> there was only blackness and silence.</p><p class="P120">It was that way for a long time before Graham could see again. His eyes opened and he was stuck to the side of a large chamber. Both his hands and his legs were held to the wall by black roots. Everywhere he looked, they were there, covering every inch of the large room. It dawned on him that he was in the hangar where they lost Grady.</p><p class="P120">A familiar voice spoke through his helmet. “Ah, you're awake. Good.”</p><p class="P123">Realization struck him and Graham said, “Hayden? Where did you come from?”</p><p class="P123">It replied, “I never left. Nor am I Hayden. Maybe once upon a time.”</p><p class="P121"><span class="T81">Graham asked, </span>“<span class="T81">If you aren't Hayden, who are you? Are you Grady. Or O'Connor?”</span></p><p class="P121">“<span class="T81">They are here as well, but I am more than him. Or them. Or it…,” the voice giggled. Then it was silent.</span></p><p class="P121">“<span class="T81">You were here watching us the whole time? Why didn't you stop us before we came in?” </span></p><p class="P121">“<span class="T81">Later,” The voice said. “I like your mind. You're curious and sharp. I find kinship in you. More than with the others. I felt it in the way you searched out the information you were looking for. Just so. I'm intrigued and... well, I want to show you something.”</span></p><p class="P122"><span class="T81">There was more laughter. </span>When the voice was finished, the room was ripped apart by deafening explosions. A line of them stretched across the length of the floor. The massive wall across the room from him fell away in pieces and blackness showed between them as they slowly drifted apart. In the blackness, there were little silver points of varying sizes. </p><p class="P122">“Stars…,” Graham said. He gasped as realization dawned on him. “You blew up <span class="T81">Phobos….</span>”</p><p class="P120">The voice laughed <span class="T81">again</span> as the chunks of the decimated room floated away. <span class="T81">The tendrils holding him gripped tighter. He shouted against the pain as they broke through his uniform. When they contacted his skin, images replaced what he was seeing. Somehow, they were being projected straight into his brain.</span></p><p class="P124">Graham saw the doctor. He was in the lab where Graham found the server, leaning over one of the pulsing jelly blobs. It was wired to a bank of machinery. <span class="T134">Nearby on the cluttered table were jars containing small scorpion creatures, specimens of fungus and a few of the baby blue protospiders.</span></p><p class="P124">Half a dozen displays scrolled varieties of information about the subject. Hayden sliced off a piece of the blob and held it between his thumb and forefinger. He turned it, admiring the blue glint in the light. “Here we go,” he said. Then he popped it in his mouth and began to chew. He swallowed and immediately took up a glass of water. <span class="T134">He </span>downed half of it. “Gah! Blech,” he said after he drank.</p><p class="P123">Graham saw the stars again and said, “So, you came to this willingly?”</p><p class="P123">“Mmm, yes. It was terrible the first time, but it showed me things. After the third time, it began to communicate with me. Much as I'm communicating <span class="T82">with</span> you now. <span class="T134">Be quiet, I have something else to show you.</span>“</p><p class="P125">The vision of space was replaced with the inside of the ship, looking at the rear bay door. Holes and scorch marks peppered its surface. Cooper and M<span class="T134">itchell</span> lay inside the cargo net to the right. Neither was moving. The scene turned to the right, to reveal Donovan laying on the floor near the tripod. M<span class="T134">cElheny</span> walked past the medical bay, where Gannon lay unconscious. He walked up the stairs to the flight deck.</p><p class="P125">He looked out the window and saw Phobos in its changed shape. It was getting smaller quickly, but the bulk of it was gone. It was clear that the alkali surface and the trees <span class="T134">were only</span> camouflage. <span class="T134">The true substance was twisting, black and crawling with spiders.</span></p><p class="P125">A <span class="T134">massive blue gray bulb pulsed where it sat at the top of the mass</span>. Beneath it was a spinning toroid with four spokes that connected it to the <span class="T134">helix</span> body of the station. At the bottom of the station was another toroid, <span class="T83">rotating</span> the opposite direction. Runners of fuzzy flesh covered the whole thing, obscuring the <span class="T134">details</span> of it. </p><p class="P126"> <span class="T83">The view left McElheny. It was as if a disembodied thing transferred itself through the window of the ship and out into the vacuum. It began to race across </span><span class="T83">the emptiness, the stars blurring in the distance as whatever was seeing them raced toward Phobos. </span></p><p class="P184">It came on faster until it neared the spinning torus at the top of the station. As it neared, the vision filled with the black mass of the creepers. As the torus turned, Graham appeared. A small man-shaped thing was stuck in the mass. The disembodied eyes he was seeing through came closer, straight for Graham's helmet. Then the vision returned to Graham's eyes.</p><p class="P127">Graham retched, but his breathing steadied as his sight returned. “<span class="T135">You</span> killed them all.”</p><p class="P127">Hayden replied, as if speaking to a child, “No, they are with us as well. Soon all will be one. It's the nature of the thing. <span class="T135">As</span> I've come to understand <span class="T135">it</span>. It's where we came from, Graham. It wants us all back, to gain <span class="T135">what</span> it can from what we've learned, since we separated from it.”</p><p class="P127">Graham said, “So you didn't create this thing? This artificial intelligence.”</p><p class="P127">“Oh, no,” Hayden chuckled. “No, I learned in short order that the dreams of creating a greater intelligence are beyond the reach of the Gaians. In fact, the pursuit itself is something of a misunderstanding. You see, we never create intelligence. We only borrow it from something else. It's all one thing, you see. It's the same already. I was forced to ask myself what to do after I realized that. I decided it was still important to bridge the gap.”</p><p class="P127">“So, you ate it?”</p><p class="P127">“In simple terms, yes. To be more accurate, I joined it. I came to it of my own will and it shared many things with me,” Hayden's voice said.</p><p class="P127">“You've got some pretty interesting tricks up your sleeve, but I don't see how it's better,” Graham said. He began to struggle against the creepers holding him.</p><p class="P127">“You'll see better from the inside,” <span class="T135">replied Hayden.</span></p><p class="P127"><span class="T135">Graham said, </span>“I think you should leave this all behind. Have Mitchell bring the ship back and let's get out of here. I'm sure the Commonwealth would love to see what you've discovered.”</p><p class="P127"><span class="T135">Hayden's tone was adamant, </span>“No. They are the past. It's time for something new. Don't you see I'm talking about life not bound by <span class="T135">distance in</span> space? Not separate <span class="T135">across even lightyears</span>.”</p><p class="P127">“<span class="T135">Doctor, y</span>ou've gone mad.”</p><p class="P128">“I'm losing my patience with you, Graham. I'm a little disappointed. I think it's time you fully understood.” With that, the communication ceased.</p><p class="P128">Graham began to scream in pain. He looked right and left, <span class="T135">to</span> s<span class="T135">ee</span> that the roots were driving into his skin beneath the uniform. His vision went gray at the edges and the screams stopped.</p><p class="P128">Then there was blackness a<span class="T135">s</span> the feed ended.</p><p class="P130">Major Loren stopped the playback and looked at Murphy. He folded his hands, not revealing <span class="T135">how</span> disturbed <span class="T135">he was</span> by the recording.</p><p class="P130">He asked, “Do we know where the ship is?”</p><p class="P129">“No sir,” replied Loren. “They didn't report in to the nearest base.”</p><p class="P129">“I suppose Mitchell's handheld was still in Graham's pocket. That means this is the only information we have on the mission.”</p><p class="P129">“Yes, I believe so, Commander Murphy.”</p><p class="P129">“We'll have to go back to Phobos, Major. Please come back in three hours. I have a meeting soon, but I will have orders for you then. I want you to lead this up.” When he finished, Murphy stood and offered his hand to the Major.</p><p class="P129">She stood up and shook it, her expression blank.</p><p class="P129">He shook her hand and said, “You did the right thing, Major. Thank you for trusting me with this.”</p><p class="P141">Their hands dropped to their sides. Murphy continued, “You're being promoted to  Lt. Colonel for this assignment. I need you to go find that ship. Get the best people you know. I want dossiers for your team when you come back.”</p><p class="P130">“<span class="T135">Yes, sir,” Loren's eyes said she was pleased, even though she gave the smart salute of a professional soldier. “Thank you, sir,” she said, then</span> turned to leav<span class="T135">e.</span> </p><p class="P130"><span class="T135">J</span>ust as she was stepping out of the office, Murphy added, “No one else, Major. I mean it.” He added this last part wearing an expression that sent <span class="T135">c</span>hills up her spine. She decided to head straight for her quarters. <span class="T135">She</span> said nothing at all to anyone on the way there.</p><p class="P129">Murphy <span class="T135">watched</span> the silent walk she made to her room on his security feed, nodded, <span class="T135">then</span> picked up the secure line. With the handset cradled in his shoulder, he typed furiously away on his computer. He was worried, but was never a man to let that keep him from action. <span class="T135">A</span>ction was demanded, with as fast a response as he could muster.</p><p class="P131">###</p></body></html>
